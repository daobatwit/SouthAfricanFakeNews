The motorist, according to Rudie Heyneke, Organisation Outdoing Tax Abuse (Outa) transport portfolio manager, was applying for credit when it was discovered they had been blacklisted for owing R60 000 in e-toll fees. Sanral had obtained a default judgment against this motorist, who allegedly had received a summons. At least 25 other e-toll defaulters have also been given default judgments, but Heyneke believes this figure is probably a lot higher. Legally, they have the right to do this. The problem that we have is that it is not ethical, as we are in the advanced stages of a test case that is testing the lawfulness of the e-toll scheme, said Heyneke. Default judgments are obtained when the debtor does not respond or defend a summons. The problem, Heyneke points out, is that debtor details are obtained from the e-Natis system, which in the past has been found to be a unreliable source of data. Summons are often sent to wrong addresses, and debtors, says Heyneke, are unaware that they have been served with the legal document. There have also been problems in the past where vehicles that are in other motorists names or where registration plates have been cloned. The state is under no obligation to inform motorists if a default judgment has been made, said Heyneke. Many defaulters will only discover they had a default judgment against them when they apply for credit. This might be when they attempt to take out a home loan. Heyneke said this could have a disastrous impact on households. Only one in three motorists is believed to be paying their e-toll bill, but Heyneke believes this figure is not accurate and that the figure of non-compliance is far higher. Many e-toll defaulters simply throw away their bills, but Outa has warned that motorists should not ignore summonses. The civil rights organisation said that if motorists are issued a summons over unpaid bills they must act quickly. It suggested motorists contact its offices for guidance. Outa also suggests that motorists should regularly check their credit ratings. Sanral was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press. The motorist who had the default judgment served against, is taking legal action to rescind the judgment. Heyneke believes if Sanral goes ahead with a mass blitz of using summons and issuing default judgments to collect on their debts, it could have a detrimental effect on the economy of Gauteng. Three million people use those highways, of that, lets say two million are not paying and are issued summons. And lets say that 30% of them dont contest this and are issued default judgments. That is 600000 people with no more credit. It would have a huge impact on the economy.

There are numerous careers that do not require a four-year degree. The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn. Here is a list of other things you can do after your high school let down; 1. Work Go out and see what the working world is really like. Take a year to work full-time and earn real money. By working full-time at a fast food joint, or as a waiter, or doing landscaping, youll learn invaluable life lessons. Youll learn about customer service, about bucking up and working even when you dont want to, about budgeting your income, about balancing life and work. Join the Military While not always a popular  or safe choice  joining the military is often a great way to learn more about yourself. Joining the military offers you a chance to serve your country, make a career in the service, and/or earn money toward a future college education. Youll also earn valuable work experience that can you can apply to civilian jobs once you get discharged. Volunteer These days volunteering is something for people to put on a college application or a resume; its always a means, never an end. So maybe spend a year volunteering out of high school, youll probably become a much better, more understanding person for it. Travel Traveling allows you to experience the world. You could fall in love with another culture and decide you want to move there. If all you can think about is getting out of your town and exploring some other part of the world, then traveling may be for you. If you dont have the money, look into student exchange programs like AIESEC, employment on cruise ships, or becoming an au pair or nanny for a family in another country. Try the arts If art is your passion you should strongly consider not attending a 4-year college. Getting an associates degree as a backup plan is a good idea, but then just put everything you have into your craft through deliberate practice, and consider moving to an art-friendly city, or one of these other top cities for artists, where you can find peers and mentors that can help critique and improve your work. Learn a trade Even if you dont pursue your chosen trade later in life, knowledge accrued during a year of learning massage therapy at a beauty school tricks or some book keeping skills will always be helpful and can save you quite a bit of money in the long run. Start A Business Some of the most successful men of the 20th and 21st centuries were entrepreneurs without a college degree. All you need is the passion, the drive, and confidence to make it all happen. While its certainly true that more small businesses fail than succeed, youd be hard-pressed to find an entrepreneur who didnt learn invaluable lessons even amidst their failures. Learn How To Play An Instrument Music can be very healthy for your emotional life. In a recent research where people where asked how they think playing their instrument plays a part in how they feel. Many people believe that playing their instrument provides an outlet to express their feelings, and some see it as a way to let loose their creative impulses. Join A Sport Sports are good for learning accountability, dedication, and leadership, among many other traits. Putting it all together by playing a sport is a winning combination. Watching your hard work pay off and achieving your dreams brings about tons of self-confidence. Also, sports will improve your fitness and weight goals. However, they also encourage healthy decisions such as not smoking or drinking and offer hidden health benefits.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/01/opportunitiess-and-options-you-have.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

These very basic views can linger in a mans mind for a year or even a lifetime, so it is important to make some solid first impressions. If you have tattoos, you should hide them as much as possible, as most rich men generally like a clean and sophisticated lady, not a biker chic. If you are truly serious about being with a rich man you should place yourself around rich men every day. The more rich men you spend time around the more dates you will get the the more options you will have. Gear your life in a way that keeps you in the circles of the wealthiest men, and keep building upon your group. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, there are a lot of rich men out there and make sure you get the chance to be seen around as many as possible. Once you have landed a few first dates you must follow the guidelines of how to win a rich man by avoiding these common mistakes. This is the time to intrigue and lure a man into your life. After dating one or two men seriously for about one year it is time to get married. You don't exactly have to be walking down the isle after knowing a man for only one year but you should feel very secure with the idea that he wants a future with you. If you don't feel secure about he being serious with you, its time to place him on the back burner and focus on another man. The reason for this is that it only takes about one year for a man to make a decision about you, and too many women let themselves become used for years on end while the guy strings her along. Men don't let themselves get jerked around in the same manner and will usually strike at their goals, succeed or fail, and then move on, but women will stew and be tormented until their self esteem is shattered. Don't let this happen to you! The cure for one man is another.

In a written plea agreement, the student, who was arrested on September 11 2018 on her way to Hong Kong, shed light on where she had obtained the cash. The accused had travelled to Hong Kong after a long-time friend of hers, Mr Faisal Jamal, had asked that she should assist him to purchase goods, the plea agreement read. The goods she was to buy were listed as PlayStations, game consoles, iPhones, laptops, iPads, notebooks, desktops, cellphones, jewellery, clothes and accessories. [Jamal] paid for her return ticket and said everything will be taken care of, including accommodation and food upon her arrival, the agreement read. The accused was only advised after her arrest and release from custody by Mr Jamal that the money that was in her possession belonged to a businessman called Mr Ravichandren Dhurgasamy. Shortly after Salehs arrest, Sars said she initially denied having the $630,700 with her, but this was uncovered when her luggage was searched. This led to the state arguing that Saleh had intentionally failed to declare the large sum of money that she had in her possession. Both the state and Salehs lawyer reached an agreement on her sentence, which saw Saleh escape jail time. The agreement read: The accused is sentenced to a fine of R200,000 or 24 months imprisonment. It is ordered  that the whole of this sentence be suspended for a period of three years, on condition that the accused is not convicted in contravention of section 15(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964 or an offence of which dishonesty is an element and for which imprisonment without the option of a fine is imposed during the period of suspension.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/04/sa-student-bust-with-r9m-cash-at-or.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

Now it's time to melt away stretch marks. \""Its fluid is hydrating, so it plumps up cells to help skin look fuller, more supple and less withered,\"" The Nutrition Twins comment. \""Plus, it contains powerful antioxidants that help to keep cells healthy and fight damage, including the damaged cells from stretched skin.\"" Kelly Choi, food journalist and author of The 7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse, adds that tea can help slow the aging process. \""According to a Case Western Reserve University study, an extract of white tea leaves may help fight wrinkles and keep your skin looking young,\"" Choi says.

The research has revealed an unbelieving increase in the curiosity of South Africans, mainly women about se_x toys saying the country came third globally for the highest number of Google searches for se_x toys, trailing the US and the UK. Addressing why this is so, se_xologists and se_x shop owners say female empowerment in the bedroom and the availability of high-quality se_x toys could be some of the attributing factors According to Adult World chief executive Arthur Kalamaris, the open-mindedness of the female population has led to the increased purchase of the toy. The whole marketplace is changing, with 55 percent of our se_x toy sales to women. It used to be male-dominated, like the man would go into the store and pick out a se_x toy, but thats completely shifted, he said. Dealers in se_x toys in the country revealed further that women were becoming more open and comfortable with introducing toys into their se_x lives, taking charge of their own pleasure. se_x should be fun. Lots of people dont know that. Some women still see it as an obligation and thats not how it should be, said Sari Cohen, owner of Cape Towns Allure Sensuality Emporium. S Customers of all ages and races were said to be patronizing the product and shop owner Cohen said she offers a senior discount and frequently attends events and parties to educate curious potential buyers. Cohen also revealed that her stockroom is filled with high-quality products that range in price from R350 to more than R3 000. I love se_x toys so much because they help women learn about themselves and their bodies, If they are used with consent and women are opening their minds to the possibility of pleasure, thats really empowering and important. It means that they are ready to love themselves and embrace themselves, she said Speaking about the research result, Brodie Meyer, the managing director of Desir Intimate Collection, another Cape Town se_x shop said he is happy with the increasing sale adding that south Africa is now traditionally accepting and associating with se_x shops. I was happy to see the study because it reiterates the need for se_x toys, managing director Brodie Meyer said. What were seeing is normalization and the creation of dialogue, along with more awareness of the adult toy industry. Meyer also pointed out that with the emergence of e-marketing, shopping for se_x toys can be private and one can do it with a partner at home, she said. However, report from the shop owner also has it that most of the women who buy the toy do hide it from their partner. It makes me sad to see them do that, but at the same time Id rather they take control of their own pleasure rather than not at all if theyre not satisfied, Cohen said On this, a local |se_xologist Dr Marlene Wasserman said se_x toys is very helpful to the se_xual health of a relationship because it builds an active communications in partners. Avoiding se_xuality is unhealthy and se_x toys are a great way to explore that and have conversations about it, he added.

The incident only came to light when one of the womens husband found the footage in her iPhone backup cloud folder. The incident was recorded using the iphone and the woman did not know her phone was set up to automatically upload videos to the cloud folder which her husband had access to.  The irate husband is said to have stormed the sangomas training house and burnt four chalets, destroying all the sangomas tools and muthi. When confronted, one of the women in the video said they were told that was the last step of their initiation process and their ancestors had ordered it.

We all have the calling from our ancestors to be sangomas and we have been here for three months training so we agreed, the woman said. The sangoma however opened a case of arson against the husband who burnt his houses and sued him for damages to property. He however gave him an ultimatum. He offered him to surrender his wife and he would drop the charges.

During the service, the high-flying minister known for his lavish lifestyle, encouraged congregants to keep praying for their miracles. Keep on receiving, you are going home with your miracle, he kept telling congregants as he prayed in tongues. A woman then shouted: Pastor Alph, something is happening outside. There is a family that is about to bring a corpse to Zimbabwe, but they are saying something is happening, man of God. As the funeral parlour drove over the church door, their neighbour said it seemed like the fingers of this dead corpse were beginning to move, she added. The pastor went outside, then asked the workers to take the coffin out of the hearse. He asked the workers to open the coffin. He spoke to the deceaseds older brother before the coffin was completely taken out of the hearse. According to the deceaseds landlord, the man had gotten sick and started coughing a lot on Friday. We took him to the hospital and they said they could not help him because he did not have papers, so we took him to the doctor and he died there, she claimed.

One of Uches friends revealed to us how she confessed to her before she died. According to reports Uche met an American based guy named Roland at a restaurant in Abuja. Roland spoilt her with money and gifts, he even bought for her, an exotic car and promised to marry her. She was very happy that she had finally met the man of her dreams. Few weeks after Uche met Roland, she started spending almost every day with him.

One of her friends who stayed with her, later took her to a white garment church in Kubwa, a suburb in Abuja.

She said, Roland liked adventure, so he suggested they should do some nasty things. She said Roland had a dog he cherished, and he suggested she sleeps with the dog while he watched her, she said she didnt want to do it, but later she had s3x with the dog, her friend further revealed that, Uche was angry after the s3x with dog show, but Roland begged her and gave her a car key(Infinity Jeep), assuring her nothing will happen to her. Roland left the country the following day, and promised to start processing her papers to come to the United States once he gets back to U.S. Uches friend and the prophet called the guy but the number didnt exist. They also asked her for the address of Rolands house in Abuja but they didnt get the address she described.

Charles Gomede said this guy should actually be hired as a points-man. WATCH VIDEO H-E-R-E Hes risking his life for people he does not even know. They dont even give him money and hes not even asking for any. Give the guy some credit, said Charles. Meanwhile, others think this is deadly and that this hustlepreneur should be punished. Dineo Mokoena said shes strongly against this. If you have an accident while being directed by a vendor/beggar will insurance pay? I dont think so. The onus is on the motorist to know and obey the rules of the road, she said. But all in all, seems like the self appointed points-man is winning the hearts of social media users.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/03/video-eskoms-load-shedding-gets-street.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

Women with HIV can experience changes to their menstrual cycle. Their periods may be lighter or heavier than normal, or they may not have a period at all. HIV-positive women may also have more severe premenstrual symptoms. Most people with HIV develop skin problems. Rash is a common symptom of HIV, and many different types of skin rashes are associated with the condition. They may be a symptom of HIV itself or the result of a concurrent infection or condition. If a rash appears, its a good idea to have a healthcare provider review ones medical history. They can use a complete medical history to determine which diagnostic tests are needed. Lymph nodes are located throughout the human body, including the neck, back of the head, armpits, and groin. As part of the immune system, lymph nodes fend off infections by storing immune cells and filtering pathogens. As HIV begins to spread, the immune system kicks into high gear. The result is enlarged lymph nodes, commonly known as swollen glands. Its often one of the first signs of HIV. In people living with HIV, swollen glands may last for several months.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/03/5-signs-woman-is-hiv-positive-even.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

Were not saying keep things from each other but some things are better left unsaid. 1. Never admit that you hate his mothereven if he badmouths her first (the Silence Is Golden rule) It can be tempting to add your two cents as your husband is telling you yet another story about his controlling, manipulative, buttinsky mother. Tempting to say, You think thats bad? The other day she told me all of our sons good qualities come from her! Shes just a delusional, dried-up old cow who wishes she could be married to you and who resents the hell out of me just because you love me! Take a deep breath and hold your tongue. Remember, he can say whatever he wants, because shes his mommy. If you agree too adamantly, bad things will happen to your relationship, not the least of which is that your husband will never let you forget your slip up and will preface everything he says about her with that. 2. Never tell him that his best friend made a pass at you(the No Harm, No Foul rule) Unless he is a repeated offender never do this. This will result in a massive fight between the two men and also your husband might start being suspicious of you. Some men might go as far as suspecting that you encouraged their friends to make a pass at you. It might end up sounding like you had an affair. 3. Never confess to past infidelities(the Dont Tell, Dont Tell rule) Now, girls, Id hope this goes without saying, but Ill mention it anyway. I dont care if you were 20 and dru_nk at the time; never admit that you cheated while in a committed relationship. On the subject of fidelity, you are above reproach. And not being a cheater yourself, you have zero tolerance for cheaters. But in all seriousness, you have to ask yourself how the relationship could possibly benefit from your true confessions, and I think youll see the answer is not at all. Doubt can do serious damage. 4. Dont tell him that one of your girlfriends is cheating on her husband(the Keep Your Big Fat Mouth Shut rule) Just keeping your own past slipups under wraps is not enough. In general, you must act as though infidelity is equal to murder. You know it exists, youve read about it in the papers, but you certainly dont know anyone who has actually committed it. (This wont always be easy) 5. Dont say hes not as hard as he used to be(the Its Your Memory Thats Getting Soft rule) So your husband doesnt have the tumescence of a 20-year-old frat boy. I bet you dont have the stamina of Venus Williams. I say this not to make you feel bad about your own aging body but to help you appreciate (or at least accept) his. 6. Never tell him that it does bother you that you make more money than he does(the Being Married to You Is a Full-Time Job rule) Really ladies, some things are better kept quiet. Is it necessary? Marriage is collective, everyone brings something to the table whether emotionally, physically or financially.

Im coming, Im coming, Im  crying? It is common for women to cry during sex but the big question is why? In most cases, people associate crying with sadness or pain however during sex, crying can be a totally different emotion. Women cry during sex because it is a way of showing appreciation of the moment. Some people cry when they are happy and these tears are called tears of joy, this feeling is the same feeling women have during sex. There are other several reasons women cry during sex , here are a few: She is in pain. A number of women have admitted to feeling pain during sex but not being able to open up to their partner and letting them know that they are hurting them. Some women feel that by letting their partner know that they are in pain, they will hurt their feelings Her emotions are all over the place. It is a known fact that besides sex being physical, it also triggers a lot of emotions. Imagine having sex and you are going through some emotionally stressing situations that you cannot even block out during sex? The tears will definitely flow. She has had a bad experience before. If a woman has had a bad experience with sex in the past, having sex can trigger those emotions while having sex. You feel super-connected Sometimes, there are no words for how deeply connected you feel to your partner. Instead, there are tears, Dr Nasserzadeh says. If sex is a way of deep connection with a partner, your body might choose this form of release to communicate your emotions, she says. Thats pretty typical, Wright adds, since sex releases oxytocin, and oxytocin promotes bonding, trust, and empathy. Its easy to feel safe to release emotions that may have been bottled up for whatever reason, she says. Youre grieving Did a relative or pet die recently? Or perhaps you got laid off or, heck, youre still not over your last breakup. Grief can strike anywhere  walking down the sidewalk, in the middle of work meeting, or, yep, mid-romp. It hurts so good Tears can also strike due to the type of pain you asked for in the form of (consensual) choking, spanking, slapping or getting tied up. Both physical pain and pleasure activate the same part of the brain, Wright says, so its totally possible to be crying from pain and be enjoying it at the same time. Youre ashamed or feeling guilty Dr Nasserzadeh has worked with women who tell her theyve cried during sex because they dont feel like they deserve to take a moment to enjoy themselves. They feel like, as a mother, they should be focusing on their child and not on self-pleasuring, she says. PSA though: You cannot take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself. If youre feeling shame around sex or intimacy in general, and it comes out in the form of tears, its a good indicator to explore that shame outside of the bedroom and see what its about, Wright adds. Youre so happy! Maybe youve had a seriously long dry spell, or maybe sex just has never been that fun or enjoyable to you. If youve never had (or rarely had) satisfying sexual interactions, it might be so wonderful that tears would be a sign of gratitude, joy or happiness, Dr Nasserzadeh says. Let em flow, let em flow, let em flow! Youre triggered Maybe youre a survivor of sexual assault, or maybe something a little off happened once that you thought youd forgotten. Cue sex to remind you. Trauma gets so deeply embedded in our minds and memory that its hard to remember exactly what happened and something [sex] will bring it up, McGuire says. Stop having sex if you feel like your brain and body are dissociating, if painful memories are coming up, or you feel out of control, Wright advises. Crying during sex can be embarrassing for some women but there are ways one can try to overcome this feeling. Try controlling your breathing during sex. Controlling your breathing can help you relax and therefore help you enjoy the process. Breathing exercises can also help by letting the mind relax and making it easier for the body to take charge of the sensation.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/04/reasons-why-women-cry-or-moan-during-sex.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

"{""published_date"": """,1/31/2018,""",""title"": """,7 Healthy Reasons to Drink Coffee,""",""text"": ""","7 Healthy Reasons to Drink Coffee Millions of people start their day with a cup of coffee. The habit of drinking coffee on the way to office or college has completely settled in the minds of students, clerks, and even moms with kids. Its delicious, it smells great, it energizes, and it helps you wake up. However, few people know that coffee also positively affects health. Here are seven reasons why you should drink a cup or two of coffee every day. 1) Coffee prevents diseases Studies conducted at Harvard have shown that 1-3 cups of coffee a day are beneficial to health because such dose significantly affect the risk of diabetes, reducing the probability of its developing. If you drink up to six cups a day, it will reduce the risk of the disease even more. Besides, the consumption of coffee reduces the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease by 80% and the probability of cancer developing by 25%. Women that drink coffee reduce their chances of getting breast cancer by 40%. 2) Coffee helps you train more effectively Before going to the gym, drink a cup of coffee. It will increase the level of endorphin in your blood in just afew minutes. Endorphins will cheer you up and charge you with vivacity for the upcoming exercises,thereby increasing the effectiveness and duration of training. If you want the best results, drink some coffee before pumping iron. 3) Coffee is good for health A cup of coffee contains more than a thousand different antioxidants important for health because they lower the inflammation of the joints and remove toxins from the body. And antioxidants neutralize free radicals, which lead to weight gain. The more antioxidants you consume, the better you feel and look. 4) Coffee increases life expectancy People, who drink coffee regularly, live longer than those who dont drink it. Its not very clear why this happens, but scientists tend to associate this with the antioxidants contained in the drink. Besides, coffee reduces the number of snacks you have during the day and improves the effect of exercises. The habit of drinking coffee successfully replaces the habit of smoking, and its much healthier, and this also affects life expectancy. 5) Coffee makes you smarter Coffee not only energizes but also makes you think: the thing is that the main component of coffee, caffeine, is a natural stimulant. In the modern world, this is the most widely used psychoactive component. Caffeine blocks the effect of adenosine, which strengthens the connections between neurons in the brain and causes the production of other types of neurotransmitters. All this leads to a stimulating effect and positively affects the brain and mood. Regular use of coffee can also help overcome emotional problems and improve cognitive abilities. Studies show that coffee improves thinking ability and problem-solving skills. 6) Coffee is good for the liver Caffeine in coffee helps self-regulation of the liver. Its regular consumption can reduce the risk of such diseases as liver cancer or cirrhosis, as well as liver failure. In addition, caffeine reduces the likelihood of alcoholic cirrhosis. These benefits dont apply to other caffeinated drinks, such as black and green tea. 7) Coffee reduces the risk of gout Gout is painful, and, which is even more sadly, it can affect any person at any age. It strikes the joints and can immobilize a person for quite a long time. Drinking coffee can relieve pain and soften gout. Those, who consume coffee few times a day, have less risk of developing gout. This is due to the same antioxidants, which lower the level of insulin and uric acid which cause gout. The cons of drinking coffee 1) Coffee kills vitamins Under the influence of caffeine, the body loses vitamin B1 which provides and regulates carbohydrate metabolism and the work of nerves. With its lack, the quality of the skin, memory, and hair deteriorates. So next time, think twice before drinking the sixth cup of coffee just to get a couple more hours of surfing the web, browsing your profile on the online dating site, or watching Netflix. 2) It can deplete the nervous system This is a result of the overdose, when coffee is too strong, and when you drink it too often. At the same time, the amount of substances that transmit signals to your nervous system is significantly reduced. Signs of nervous exhaustion include irritability, depression, frequent palpitation, and insomnia. To prevent this, you need to drink no more than 2-3 cups of coffee a day. 3) It washes off minerals from the body Due to the diuretic effect, coffee can wash off calcium, magnesium, and other minerals and trace elements from the body. Because of this, a person, who regularly consumes coffee even in normal doses, may experience weakness, depression, heart problems, and headaches. You can partly prevent the excretion of nutrients if you add milk to the drink and consume vitamins and food supplements containing minerals.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2018/01/7-healthy-reasons-to-drink-coffee.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

While pregnancy is the main cause behind stretch marks, other reasons can be sudden gain or loss in weight, rapid growth, heredity factors, stress and changes in physical conditions. Fortunately, there are several natural ways to reduce the appearance of stretch marks. 1. Potato Juice Potato juice contains vitamins and minerals that foster growth and restoration of skin cells.

I mean, you are his lady hes supposed to let you in on everything, but when his security becomes more important than you then you should know there is another lady (or ladies) in the picture. 2. FREQUENTLY CHANGES HIS PASSWORD One trick men use is tell you their password today and change it the next day. He knows that you would become suspicious if he doesnt give you his password to his phone, so he cleverly tells you the pass and changes it later on, so you wont have to access his phone without asking him. 3. FEELS EDGY WHEN YOURE WITH HIS PHONE A call or message from his side chic could come in when you are with his phone, so this makes him uncomfortable when you are with his phone for long periods. Dont think because hes given you his phone then it means hes clean; if he acts edgy and strange then you should know that your man is probably cheating. 4. SWITCHES OFF HIS PHONE WHEN YOU AROUND Most ladies dont know this but it happens a lot. A lady once told me of her past relationship; she called off the relationship when she noticed that her man never receives calls when with her, not that calls wont come in but he smartly puts off his network so as to make his line unreachableif you ask me, Id say smart move, but it just shows he has numerous women in his life. So ladies, if your man is exhibiting any of these signs, you should toe the part of caution as there is every tendency that your man is cheating on you.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2018/05/5-signs-your-man-is-hiding-things-from.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

A former classmate of Themane's said that she was hurt by the manner in which he is believed to have died. \""We went to Flora Park Comprehensive high school and matriculated in 2011 together.

According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram they have attended to several of these cases over the festive season, Balram says several madalas were robbed of cash, watches and other valuables. Some of the victims were lured from Wick Street, in Verulam to the abandoned church yard - after they were promised sexual intercourse and oral sex, Balram said. After they arrive at the abandoned church, the men would then be approached by drug users, who wait in a temporary structure. The victims would reportedly then be robbed at knife-point and assaulted. Other victims are approached by the two females and robbed. The woman recently forcefully removed R1000 in cash from a pensioner. This after they accused him of failing to pay for sexual services, Balram added. The women were eventually arrested by Reaction officers on Tuesday, after a victim spotted them.

Bushiris church, Enlightened Christian Gathering, organised a night of celebration for Mboro, who turned 50 early this year. Bushiri gave Mboro R1million cash as a birthday gift. For years, the two did not get along, but they seem to have put their differences aside. Bushiri said that if prophets did not celebrate each other, no one would love or honour them or take them seriously. It is not easy. If you look at traditional healers, they dont fight one another and they stand together. But men of God fight, we need to stand together. Our styles of ministry are different, but we serve one Jesus, Bushiri said. He added that when he saw Mboros work with his generous deeds and the impact he had made in peoples lives through healing and miracles, he had to celebrate the man of Gods life. A congregant said Mboro delivered her from her drinking addiction which was triggered by her divorce. I used to drink a lot. I would drink from 6pm to the next morning. I was a gangster and used to carry a gun. Most of my friends were men and you dont want to know what we used to do. I came to church and I found Jesus. I have now touched many lives through Mboros guidance, she said. Motsoeneng said he was very emotional after the gesture. He thanked everyone in attendance especially his mother.

I have built houses for many people but I felt I have not done enough for her so I am grateful for her life. Bushiri, youve almost brought tears in my eyes. I dont know what to say. Though we fight often, I dont hold grudges. Even the Bible says I should love my enemies, he said.

Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed on Tuesday that the Polokwane police were investigating a case of murder in Flora Park, a leafy suburb near the central business district of Polokwane, over the weekend. According to police information, the man had been arguing with a group of pupils who were at the school over the weekend. The pupils then allegedly brutally assaulted him, throwing stones and dragging him on to a public road, while several recorded videos and cracked jokes during the assault. The bruised and bloody man was discovered by motorists who called the police. According to police records, the attack happened on Sunday at about 9.50am. WATCH VIDEO HERE On arriving at the scene, police found the man lying along a street. He was taken to the hospital where he was certified dead on arrival. Initial investigations revealed that the victim had been assaulted by a group of people in the area and one person was taken in for questioning. The motive behind this incident is not clear at this stage, but ongoing investigations will find the exact cause. One Flora Park resident, who said her child was a pupil at the school, said the parents were worried that only a few of the pupils, who did not have ties with the powers that be at the local police station, were called in for questioning. This was after it emerged that the father of one suspected killer in the group was a high-ranking police officer. We want all children identified to have taken part in the assault and the killing of the man to be named and shamed. Otherwise justice will not be served in this matter, because only the haves are treated with velvet gloves and the poor and the lesser known differently, said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Ngoepe said five pupils between the ages of 15 and 17 years were arrested and further arrests would be determined by the outcome of investigations. Democratic Alliance (DA) provincial chairperson Jacques Smalle called on the Limpopo department of education to beef up security at the school. According to the reports received by the DA, the use of drugs cannot be ruled out in the boys wayward actions. Some of these children are seen on the video bragging about the gruesome incident. That is so heartless. The life of a person is not tantamount to that of a locust. It takes a lot of guts to fight a person, let alone kill them. It is therefore very important for the authorities to check all the angles and take drastic action against the offenders, said Smalle. The provincial department of educations spokesperson Sam Makonde said no official statements or reports had been sent from the school, but the department had received information from the police. The department had dispatched a psychosocial team to the school to provide counselling so the focus returns to teaching and learning while the law takes its course.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/02/update-on-capricorn-high-school.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

Early treatment using antiretroviral drugs also makes the virus undetectable, which can prevent transmission to other people. Early symptoms of HIV The early signs of HIV may appear as symptoms similar to those caused by the flu. These can include: headache fever tiredness swollen lymph nodes sore throat thrush rash muscle and joint pain ulcers in the mouth ulcers on the genitals night sweats diarrhea Early HIV symptoms generally arise within one to two months after transmission, although they can arrive as soon as two weeks after exposure, according to HIV.gov.

Semenya, a double Olympic champion, was fighting measures imposed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) that compel hyperandrogenic athletes  or those with differences of sexual development (DSD)  to lower their testosterone levels if they wish to compete as women. A three judge panel at the Court of Arbitration for Sport said it had some serious concerns as to the future practical application of these DSD regulations. Even though the regulations are discriminatory such discrimination is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the IAAFs aim of preserving the integrity of female athletics in the Restricted Events, the Lausanne-based court said in a statement. The IAAF insisted the rules were essential to preserve a level playing field and ensure that all female athletes can see a path to success. The verdict is certain to cause controversy, as Semenya was backed by a global coalition of nations and scientific experts who argued that testosterone is an arbitrary and unfair measure for determining gender. Experts also stressed that achieving excellence in sport is a combination of training and commitment as well as genetics and that barring people from competition over a single genetic factor has no scientific basis. In a rare intrusion into the world of sport, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution last month branding the IAAF rules unnecessary, humiliating and harmful. The IAAF has countered that DSD athletes with male levels of testosterone get the same increases in bone and muscle size and strength and increases in haemoglobin that a male gets when they go through puberty. Semenyas testosterone levels are not publicly known, but she is unlikely to be the only athlete affected by Wednesdays verdict. The two athletes who finished behind her in the Rio Olympics 800m, Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi and Kenyas Margaret Wambui, have also faced questions about their testosterone levels. However, the judges want the IAAF to apply the rules only up to the 800m because the evidence was not clear that women with hyperandrogenism have a competitive advantage in the 1 500m. The CAS Panel suggested that the IAAF consider deferring the application of the DSD Regulations to these events (1 500m and the mile) until more evidence is available, the court said. That could give Semenya a route to compete at the world championships without taking medication. She was the bronze medalist in the 1 500m at the 2017 worlds in London. A further appeal is possible to Switzerlands supreme court in Lausanne. Federal judges rarely overturn CAS decisions, but can intervene if legal process was abused.",""",""url"": """,https://www.mzansistories.com/2019/05/caster-semenya-loses-testosterone-fight.html,""",""medium"": """,mzanzi stories,"""},"

Tabloid Sunday World has reported on further details around the sad end of gospel star Lundi Tyamara, who passed away this month and was still being remembered at his funeral on Sunday in Worcester. Despite the fact that Lundi was a commercial success and is understood to have enjoyed high album sales, he was reportedly evicted from the townhouse he had been renting in Mondeor, Johannesburg. The owner confirmed to the tabloid that he had sold the house in December and the new owner was in a hurry to take occupation. According to Sunday World, Tyamara needed to borrow R950 from a friend to pay a storage fee for furniture. The friend reportedly said that the singer complained that Anele Hlazo, who was his manager, was the reason he was broke. Hlazo told the tabloid he was only willing to offer his side of what had happened between himself and Lundi after the funeral.

I learnt that James along with my other two sons Beston Khamba and Brain Glant were traveling in a vehicle that collided with a truck and in the process overturned and claimed the life of all three of them. When one of our own goes to sleep tragically, we often ask ourselves so many questions. And while we might not have answers to all of them, we should however be comforted in knowing that those who leave us are only sleeping and they will wake up again when Christ comes back. But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope (1 Thess. 4:13). I know that, though life often requires us to, we are never ready to say goodbye to those we love. Thoughts of spending days without their presence is often an extremely dawning thought. And it often seems like we have all the time in the world, only to realize how fleeting time really is. But our faith in Christ has taught us this one thing, that death will never be proud. WATCH PICTURES H-E-R-E The matter is under investigation. As news of Jamess death broke, tributes continued to pour in on social media for the renowned singer, writer, producer, and businessman. Death is not about dying at an old age because even Jesus died at a young age of 33. But death is about moving away from the physical once you have fulfilled your destiny in Christ. It is about resting whilst awaiting the second coming of Christ where we shall spend eternity with Him. You have touched the hearts of so many who owe you a lifetime of gratitude my Sons. You worshipped God relentlessly. Travelled the globe with the aim of making Jesus known. You were a great part of ensuring that souls were won to Christ. Your dedication, commitment, submission and loyalty to God have left an example through which millions will follow. I am not saying goodbye forever but goodbye for now, for one day we shall join you as we cry holy holy holy to God alongside the 24 elders in heaven. As tears flow from my eyes with a heart heavy with the weight of losing you, I will also celebrate your life because you have taught so many the true meaning of living. Living for God! You were and are still an inspiration to all, with a heart that radiated love and warmth through all our lives. You will truly be missed and forever remembered. I love you, thank you for making me a very proud Dad! I, therefore urge all my son's and daughters to join in prayer as we celebrate the lives of my sons.

The 19-year-old from Klipspruit, Soweto, told Daily Sun he uses human kak to make electricity. And if there is enough of it, he hopes to solve the countrys power generation problems. He said he got the idea from his mum, who told him about a woman who had fallen into a pit toilet and died because of the heat in the hole. This made me realise pit toilets have loads of power, he said. In 2015 he decided to test his theory. First Thabo caught kak fumes in a plastic squeeze bottle. He closed the lid and threw the bottle into a fire. When the bottle popped before it caught fire he carried on with his experiment. I scraped nails with sandpaper and dipped them in methanol before I attached the nails to a wire. I inserted the wire inside a pit toilet where the kak was boiling. Then I attached the wire to a light bulb. The heat from the human waste heated up the wire and the bulb lit up. The energy that Thabo creates is similar to what happens inside your stomach when you eat food. Kak gradually gets broken down into biogas. Thabo wants government to use his idea to create jobs for unemployed young people.

It is believed that the Grade 12 pupil from Emmanuel Secondary School was walking with friends during the early hours of Sunday morning when they were approached by a group of men who were armed with knives. The boys family, as well as the school, is still reeling in shock over the tragedy. Relatives have urged the public to be on the lookout for the stolen shoes as they believe that this could lead the police to the suspects, who have yet to be arrested. It is a brown pair of size 9 Carvela shoes with a buckle. Joseph Ndlovu said on Monday that he had saved for months to buy the shoes for his eldest son, Boniface Ndlovu, to wear to his matric dance this past Friday. Boniface was so happy and proud to be able to wear his shoes. His mother is heartbroken and the entire family is traumatised, said Joseph. Boniface was accompanying one his friends home at the time of the incident. We were sleeping when we received the news that he had been stabbed. By the time we arrived on the scene near the sports field, near Stock and Stock, he had already died. It is very painful to have to bury your own child. Joseph believes that the streets of Kimberley are not safe. I dont want my other two sons and two daughters walking in the streets after dark any more. He said they were still busy planning the funeral arrangements, although they are hoping to hold the service this weekend. Bonifaces uncle, Andre van Rooyen, added that the rest of his nephews friends had managed to flee from the group of armed men. It was dark, so they said they could not remember much because everything happened so fast. Some of their shoes and belongings were also stolen in the process, said Van Rooyen. He added that according to the autopsy results, Boniface was stabbed twice in the heart. The stab wounds were fatal. There was no chance that he would have survived. Boniface was one of the top 10 academic pupils at his school. His dream was to join the South African National Defence Force and study engineering. He had submitted an online application to the University of Stellenbosch on Friday. The deputy principal of Emmanuel Secondary School, Gladys Poonawassy, said that counselling had been arranged for pupils at the school on Monday. Psychologists and social workers provided counselling to the teachers and pupils and a youth pastor from CRC church prayed over them and provided support. We are all shaken over what happened. The Grade 12s were supposed to write Geography on Monday but we have postponed the exams until Thursday. Poonawassy added that Boniface was one of the schools top achievers. He was a hard worker who was dedicated to his studies and was extremely well behaved, well mannered, with a great personality. It is a huge loss for the school. She said that the matric dance that was held on Friday went smoothly, without any incident. The matrics did not even attend an after-party as they are busy writing exams. Poonawassy said a memorial service would be held at the school hall at 1pm on Thursday. Members from the school community and pupils will also attend and assist with the funeral. Police spokesperson Sergeant Majang Skalkie said that the Galeshewe police were looking for information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. Skalkie said that the deceased, aged 17 years old, was apparently approached by a group of 10 men who were armed with knives. The incident occurred on Sunday, March 10 between 12.30am and 1am at a sports ground at Stock and Stock in Galeshewe. The deceased was walking with four of his schoolmates from Homevale to Galeshewe when they were approached by approximately 10 unknown men armed with knives. They allegedly robbed them of their shoes, clothes and stabbed the deceased. Skalkie stated that the victim was stabbed twice in the chest and died on the scene. No suspects have been arrested yet. She appealed to the community to contact the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Steven Wax, on 082 469 1728 if they had any information relating to the incident.

The clinic is named after the church's Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane's grandmother Mahlaku Lekganyane. According to Lekganyane, his grandmother was a loving woman who was given wisdom by God that her children needed more than bread to live. He said Mahlaku had six children whom she taught to live a Christian life. My grandmother was also a loving person. She taught her children to love other people. She believed in the word kamoka, where she believed that good things could be achieved when people unite and work together as one. She had a sense of community. The Republic of Botswana and South Africa are one today henceforth, he said. Accepting the churchs good deed, the Minister of Health and Wellness Dorcas Makgato, said the donation of the clinic could not have come at any better as the government was engaged in coming up with strategies aimed at improving healthcare. She added that their healthcare system had over the years grown from strength to strength with primary healthcare as its cornerstone. She said in pursuit of quality and safe healthcare services, the government has invested in major health infrastructure. Makgato further explained that they built healthcare facilities that deliver healthcare services at different level of care. She added that those developments ensured that healthcare services were within reach of their communities. The process of establishing this clinic started in October 2015 and it has been achieved today with the help of our Public Private Partnership from Kganya Botswana, a product of the ZCC. I am reliably informed that Kganya Botswana has spent over P9 million to erect this clinic, she said. She said since Mmopane Block 1 had estimated population of 40,655, it was imperative that its community members have access to medical services. She said they could have built a clinic in the area back in 2010, but due to financial constraints, their goals ran futile till the church came to their rescue. The Mahlaku Lekganyane Clinic has 21 rooms which include the reception area, screening room, consultation and observation rooms, child welfare room, restroom for health officers, pharmacy and laundry room. The clinic will be opened for eight hours. According to the minister, 5,395 patients had already been consulted during the trials since last year November to date. According to the former Vice President, Ponatshego Kedikilwe, the clinic started off as an idea between him and the churchs bishop back in 2014 when he expressed his concern over various issues affecting Batswana such as HIV and AIDS and other health-related challenges. Upon the Bishops second visit, he expressed interest in building a clinic and that is when a few areas were selected of which after investigations we found it fit to build a clinic in Mmopane Block 1. MoHW helped us find the construction company, which was given nine months to have finished the job. The building was constructed in September last year and was finished in May this year, he said. Kedikilwe encouraged the community to take care of itself. He further explained that the relevance of church was to care for both members and those who do not follow it. He stated that all the churches must follow suit the examples of ZCC and practice what they preach. According to community member, who is also a task force member, Ethel Gumede, the clinic would help her community because they would no longer have to travel long distances to access health services. She said they used to get access to health facilities in nearby areas such as Nkoyaphiri, Metsimotlhabe and Mmopane clinic that were always congested. I however, urge the ministry to make this clinic operate 24 hours as we really need access to health facilities in Mmopane Block 1.

Luckily, the cops rescued the innocent man and took him to hospital, where he is fighting for his life, although the mob set his shack ablaze. And in the aftermath of this violence, it has emerged that the girl who accused him was lying. She did not sleep at home and would not answer questions about her whereabouts. But when pressed, she said she had been raped. Resident Pule More (38) from Dinoheng, a kasi near Maokeng in Kroonstad, told Daily Sun that the girls family was worried when she didnt return home on Friday. We later discovered that she lied about the rape to cover up where she was on the day. Her story got out of control and it turned a vengeful mob on an innocent man. Pule said the madala had pleaded with residents. He swore he did nothing to the girl but it was in vain. They kept beating him until the cops were called and rescued him, he said. Another resident said: We wasted no time when the girl claimed she was raped and knew the suspect so we took the law into our own hands. Its bad to hear the man was falsely accused but we wanted to send a clear message to rapists and show them how we will deal with them.

After losing out on Idols SA glory two years ago to Karabo Mogane, she now steps out as an actress. Moremi has been announced as one of the leading faces of the SABC2 drama Bone of My Bones. She plays Thembi, a school teacher married to Karabo Mohlala, played by the award winning Aubrey Poo. The drama that promises to be gripping unfolds as Karabo, a musician wanna-be, struggles to break into the music industry. This leaves a frustrated Thembi to bear the brunt of being the bread winner who keeps the family afloat financially on a modest school teacher's salary. Moremi gushed: \""There's a first time for everything, I am excited about the role and feeling blessed to a part of such an accomplished cast as this. The role puts me in a different light from the singing girl everyone loves. \""I've always wanted to sing. I didn't grow up wanting to act, I discovered it in high school and in tertiary my love for it grew further. I decided to go for lessons from Fumani Shilubana, who acted as Detective Dabula on Isidingo.

Not that Moremi has turned her back on music. In fact, she will be recording her debut album live on March 3 at Atterbury Theatre in Pretoria. She said of the album: \""It's called The Definition of Me; people will get to find out more about this woman they love so much. I am a born- again child of the most high, woman of God.

The young woman can be heard apologising repeatedly to the church leader who is giving her a hiding. South Africans were enraged by a video of church leaders, allegedly from the Endumisweni Faith Mission in Mdantsane, beating a young woman with a water pipe at the churchs NU8 branch. The woman beating the young woman has been identified by social media users as founder and leader of Endumisweni Gospel Group, Tsidi Spampool. Her name Tsidi Spampool, founder and leader of Endumisweni Gospel Group. She is notoriously known for doing this at Endumisweni Faith Mission-Nu8. The girl she is assaulting is not her daughter.

In the video, she is heard talking about the young woman drinking alcohol and posting it on social media. Church leader Asivo Nosenga told the Dispatch that beating unruly children was part of the churchs disciplinary methods. Who are they trying to show that they are drinking while they are under a church that is [well] known [in the community]. We are trying to protect children from outside influences such as drugs; these are girls and they will get drunk and [can then] become rape victims, they were quoted as saying.
