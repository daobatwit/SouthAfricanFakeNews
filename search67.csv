This law forced Black women (Slaves or Free) to cover their hair with a Tigon Cloth. This Law prevented Black women to display their hair in public because their hairstyles were more beautiful than those of White women and appeared more attractive to White males. Black women are often praised and revered for their hair. The texture of black hair is suitable for forming unique styles from the afro to braids. Even mainstream media often imitate styles invented and catered to women with Afrocentric hair without a mention of appreciation. Nevertheless, there was a time when black women weren’t allowed to display their hair in public. Keep reading to learn about the Tignon Laws and how it was used to fuel racial tensions in the United States. A tignon (tiyon) is a headdress used to conceal hair. It was adorned by free and slave Creole women of African ancestry in Louisiana in 1786. The sumptuary law was enacted under Governor Esteban Rodriguez Miró. The regulation was meant as a means to regulate the style of dress and appearance for people of color. Black women’s features often attracted male white, French, and Spanish suitors and their beauty was a perceived threat to white women. The tignon law was a tactic used to combat the men pursuing and engaging in affairs with Creole women. Simply put, black women competed too openly with white women by dressing elegantly and possessing note-worth beauty. Nonetheless, black women did not despair. Instead, they abided by the rule and turned it into fashion. The women used unique colors, jewels, ribbons, and wrapping styles which accentuated their gorgeousness even more. Out of this bore the various head ties seen today on women of color using unique materials, patterns, and flair. Tignons have been worn by women in the Caribbean islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Dominica which included hidden messages. They used Madras – a popular fabric amongst slaves and free women to achieve their head ties. Tignon law eventually went out of effect in the 1800’s yet, black women worldwide continue to use head wraps as wardrobe staples paying homage to their culture, signifying their pride, and looking stunning while doing so.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2020/06/30/tignon-law-a-must-read-for-black-women-in-brazilian-weaves-and-wigs/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

Yet another ‘quick buck’ digital scheme has hit South Africa. This time, it’s WhatsApp gifting or stokvels. How do these work? People are recruited to join a WhatsApp gifting or stokvel group (using a WhatsApp chat group) by paying a joining fee. So, in order to be added to the group, you have to pay up. The average joining fee is R200, with the promise of around R1 000 return if you recruit two people into the group. When WhatsApp stokvels go wrong… \""My aunt recruited me for a WhatsApp gifting or Stokvel,\"" says Mbali, a student at the University of Johannesburg. \""I didn’t trust it at first until I was contacted by the group admin.

Another name for a pyramid scheme is a Ponzi scheme. Pyramid or Ponzi schemes work by recruiting investors, who in turn get promised payment or returns if they recruit more people. The reality is that the person at the top of the scheme collects all the money, and those being recruited further down rarely see all, if any, of what was promised to them. The first few people to join or invest reap the rewards and the rest, typically, lose money.

If you say R20 000 per taxi that comes up to R10 billion, the government will not have R10 billion in its kitty to provide to the taxi industry,\"" Mbalula said. He said it was not possible to award the industry more than the allocated amount as the government had no funds. Various industries had been impacted by the closure of businesses, Mbalula said. \""Our response to the virus has been informed by goodwill and sacrifices. Industries have fallen apart. Such industries should be saved if we can save them,\"" he said. Taxi owners will have to be genuine registered operators to benefit from the funding. The taxi industry had reportedly demanded more than the R1 billion being offered by the government. Like other industries, taxis have been required to reduce their load capacities in an attempt to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Because of this, the industry has suffered from reduced income. Last week, various taxi associations said they would be increasing their prices to make up for the lost income. In most areas taxis fees will increase by R7. Mbalula said his meeting with the taxi industry had also focused on possibly going back to the 100% capacity.

Sunday Sun reports that sources close to the couple claim they broke up late last year and Conco has moved out of the home Zuma was renting for her at Zimbali’s plush Hilltop Private Estate in Durban. Insiders allegedly told the publication that Conco was instructed by the Zuma family to keep the separation under wraps.ADVERTISING Security personnel at the estate reportedly told the publication that Conco had moved out of her home last December shortly after her last visit from Zuma. Her estranged father, Fartescue Cocnco, confirmed that she has moved to her mother’s home in the Eastern Cape. Nonkanyiso and Fartescue have had a strained relationship since her relationship with the country’s former president went public. This, allegedly due to the fact that Zuma had not shown her family respect by completing all the necessary rites and rituals for their relationship and the two-year-old child they share. Conco made headlines earlier this year after an Instagram post she put up was interpreted to mean that she was raising her son without the help of his father. In an Instagram post addressed to her son, Conco expressed her gratitude to him and said he was the reason she needed to work harder.

Sassa acknowledges that the WhatsApp system for applications was flooded with unprecedented numbers of applications per hour, which it struggled to cope with but had to move to other platforms like their website and unstructured supplementary service data (USSD). We received just under 5 million applications for this new grant and we had to compare information provided by applicants with other government and private databases to ensure that people with an income and recipients of other social grants are not included in these applications. In addition, we had to remove duplicated and incomplete applications which account for nearly 50% of all applications received.

"{""published_date"": ""","MAY 26, 2020",""",""title"": """,Who is Adriano Mazzotti and what is he known for?,""",""text"": ""","Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you to grab a chair and a jug of water as my analytic scepticism ruffles up a few feathers. I’m going to unravel a little Mr, by the name of Adriano Mazzotti. So, who is Adriano Mazzotti? Adriano Mazzotti is a director of a cigarette company, Carnilinx, which is under investigation by SARS for smuggling and tax evasion. Like sordid and infernal scenes from a thriller movie, everything about this man is robustly captivating and demands the utmost sobriety to fathom fully. They say \""all are not thieves that dogs bark at\"" but surely if integrity sells for so little, it is only fair that proper analysis is conducted before a conclusion is arrived at. In 2005, Adriano Mazzotti and his ally within the alleged crime clique, Martin Wingate-Pearse, became the target of a massive South African Revenue Services’ (SARS) raid on suspicion of drug smuggling. But like any mafia movie, the predictability of the outcome was as the coming of tomorrow – no drugs were found! Upon realising that he was being investigated by SARS and the SAPS for drug smuggling Mazzotti, via his company Carnilinx, allegedly hired private investigators to gather information on those who were investigating him so as to halt the probes into his tax affairs. To this end a case was subsequently opened by SARS. The Mail & Guardian identified a notorious international fugitive, Antonio Lamas, to be a part of Glenn Agliotti’s group, along with Martin Wingate-Pearse and Adriano Mazzotti. There hasn’t been any remotely robust influence by Mazzotti of high note in the media, other than the raid on his home and his questionable relations to Glenn Agliotti. On the other hand considering that he’s in the cigarette company, similarly as Glenn was, leaves a lot of questions unanswered. It is almost as if Mazotti was being groomed to fill in the big underworld shoes that was used by Glenn. After-all, you’re only as good as the company you keep. His sudden political interests are rather eyebrow raising of note. Glenn was linked to President Mbeki, and Mazzotti told City Press that he is good friends with EFF President, Julius Malema, after admitting that he gave Julius R200 000 to register his party for elections. To an ordinary South African, that is an awful lot of money. It is enough to guarantee a prolonged life that is somewhat hunger-free. To the rich underworld individuals, R200 000 merely amounts to a water droplet in a pond. Did the then-estranged Juju’s loyalty cost such peanuts, or is there actually a lot more to this than meets the eye? This pattern is almost monotonous, but the denouement and climax of the plot always tend to slightly alter. Now here’s the cinema part, one which I feel Mazzotti must account for before seeking to further himself in Glenn’s footsteps. Belinda Walter was the attorney for Carnilinx. Carnilinx Director, Kyle Philip, claimed British American Tobacco (BAT) paid Belinda Walter to spy on Carnilinx and leak information to them. Later on, Belinda did the 360 degrees turn and quit as attorney for Carnilinx only to date Van Loggerenberg, the head of SARS investigating her former client Carnilinx. The \""surprise\"" was convenient for Carnilinx, not so? After the alleged probing or spying on those investigating him, it looked like he finally found a sink-hole. Thus emerged an evidently well orchestrated commotion of enigma whereby the art of pointing fingers at each other cancelled out the important matter at hand. It was as much a circus as that occurring in parliament. Playfulness and confusion played the role of a smoke screen. Carnilinx claimed that Belinda Walter fed information about them to SARS and Belinda Walter claimed that Carnilinx was offered tax leniency in exchange for filing the application against her. So for a person who claims to serve the people, what exactly is Julius Malema doing with Adriano Mazzotti? This Julius, an orator and facetious comedian, seeks to find friendships with all the bad guys – just like those girls loving bad boys. For a nay singer, he surely strikes as a type to sing out of tune when the shoe is on the other foot. The matter of note is that Adriano Mazzotti managed, in one way or the other, to influence judgement on his SARS investigation. Glenn Agliotti is a free man today. Malema is cleared of sequestration. Really, these are the kind of things that only happen in the movies. Julius, the agent of London and the water boy of the underworld – a pipeline link between international might, monarchy and international drug dealings. It is time we open our eyes South Africans.

"{""published_date"": ""","MAY 26, 2020",""",""title"": """,SASSA media statement on payment of R350 special grants under Level 3 lockdown,""",""text"": ""","Today SASSA issued a media statement on payment of R350 special grants. The statement was issued as follows: Level 3 lockdown announcement enables faster payment of COVID-19 grants Sunday’s announcement by His Excellency President Matamela Ramaphosa in response to the Corona virus epidemic brings much needed hope to the country. It also enables SASSA to accelerate the pace of paying out the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant. In terms of the move to level 3 of the lockdown, government services will commence full reopening from 01 June 2020. At the moment SASSA is operating with a third of its staff during level 4 and a move to level 3 will increase human resource capacity drastically so that payments are made quicker than it is the case currently. Much progress has been made in preparing for the payment of large numbers of the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grants. SASSA started using WhatsApp for applications but had to move to other platforms like the srd.sassa.gov.za website and Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). This was after the WhatsApp system was flooded with unprecedented numbers of applications per hour, which it struggled to cope with. The situation was also further challenged by the fact that applicants tried to upload supporting documents through the various platforms, despite this not being necessary. All these application channels have been stabilised and the application process is now significantly smoother. After increasing capacity of the application channels, SASSA moved swiftly to testing the payment side of its system. A sample of 10 beneficiaries was used to test the efficacy of the payment mechanism and 9 were successfully paid. One applicant had captured his banking details incorrectly. This has since been corrected. This payment test should be seen for what it is. Just under 5 million applications have been received and this figure includes duplications, incomplete and invalid applications. Some applicants were sent messages to provide banking details and they are requested to respond as quickly so that they can be paid before month end. Unbanked applicants will be paid through money send using an ATM of their choice. SASSA will finalise contracting for this facility with the banks today so that such payments can be made this week. Beneficiaries can also open accounts at their nearest post office. It was important for SASSA to only start paying out this grant after tight systems have been established and tested to avoid wasteful expenditure and fraud. It has not been as easy as it has been made out to be in media circles due to the dependencies along the value chain The mammoth task of ensuring that the correct and deserving individuals are paid has started in earnest. This process involved intense negotiations with institutions in the value chain and this unfortunately accounted for the delays that were encountered. These delays proved to be worth it, given the number of applicants that could be excluded during the process as they are either in receipt of social grants or UIF – two factors which expressly disqualify applicants from receiving this grant. SASSA CEO Totsie Memela however extended an unreserved apology to those inconvenienced by the slower than expected process. \""We received just under 5 million applications for this new grant and we had to compare information provided by applicants with other government and private databases to ensure that people with an income and recipients of other social grants are not included in these applications. In addition, we had to remove duplicated and incomplete applications which account for nearly 50% of all applications received. Up to now, we have eliminated a number of undeserving applicants and this has saved the Fiscus close to R14 million which could have sky-rocketed to over R81 million by October. As soon as the vetting of applications is completed, the payments will start rolling in at an even faster pace\"". Citizens are reminded that no applications for the special COVID-19 relief grant will be taken at SASSA offices because only electronic applications are accepted. In order to comply with the restrictions on services during level 4 of the lockdown, SASSA local offices have specific dates on which they attend to selected grants. On Mondays and Tuesdays local offices strictly attend to applications for Old Age Grants On Wednesdays and Thursdays local offices strictly attend to applications for Child Support Grants and foster child grants.

She was apparently scheduled to start working for the Limpopo department of health two months ago.

"{""published_date"": ""","MAY 22, 2020",""",""title"": """,Live News | Tobacco and alcohol ban to continue until Level 1: Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,""",""text"": ""","Cooperative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has told the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) that the sale of tobacco and alcohol should continue to be banned until the country reaches Level 1 of the lockdown. News24 was reliably told that Dlamini-Zuma was supported by Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi when she told the NCCC this week that she believed it would be too much of a health risk to allow the sale of cigarettes and alcohol on 1 June when the country is expected to go to Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown. This prompted a debate in the meeting, chaired by President Cyril Ramaphosa, with no resolution on the matter. A high-ranking insider with intimate knowledge of the meeting said Dlamini-Zuma had come prepared with academic papers that argued against the sale of tobacco and alcohol during the Covid-19 pandemic, citing health risks. President Cyril Ramaphosa has rubbished claims that there is any agenda from government in the banning of tobacco products during the Covid-19 Level 4 national lockdown. This is despite an agreement that government would lift the restrictions on the sale of tobacco under Level 3. Those who opposed the proposal led by Dlamini-Zuma argued that a pandemic was not the time to make policy decisions, as both the tobacco and alcohol industries were not banned – they were simply regulated. ‘There is no finality’ A reliable insider said that even Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who initially supported the ban, seemed to have come to terms with the fact that cigarettes and alcohol should be allowed with strict conditions under Level 3. There was no decision on the matter, the source said. \""The discussion goes on and on and there is no finality,\"" the insider said. This is not the first time the NCCC has heard lively discussions around the ban on tobacco and alcohol. An announcement by Ramaphosa to allow the sale of those products under Level 4 was rescinded days later after vehement opposition led by Dlamini-Zuma. The Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association has challenged government’s decision in court, and the Presidency and Dlamini-Zuma have until next Tuesday to provide the record of the decision and the reasons why tobacco was banned in the first place. Dlamini-Zuma’s spokesperson Mlungisi Mtshali said he could not comment on matters currently before the NCCC. Efforts to get comment from Motsoaledi were also unsuccessful. This will be added should News24 receive it. The NCCC has also heard arguments calling for the reopening of hairdressers and salons under Level 3. It was argued that women, who are the majority in that industry, were at risk of losing their livelihoods. More than 8 000 people have made inputs to government calling for the reopening of salons and hairdressers. While the matter is still unresolved, it is understood that there seemed to be an indication that there would be \""enhanced regulations\"" if salons were to reopen. Another point of contention before the NCCC is the opening of restaurants under strict \""protocols\"". While takeaways and drive-thrus will be open under Level 3, there is a contention that sit-down restaurants should be open. The NCCC finally agreed that there would be limited domestic air travel under Level 3, with hotels and licenced accommodation allowed to operate to assist businesses. This too would come with strict conditions. What is allowed The NCCC’s members seemed to be in agreement that all manufacturing, mining, agriculture, forestry and fisheries would be opened under Level 3. All retail would also be opened, with some restrictions. It was further agreed that the construction industry would be reopened and that all other supporting jobs would also be allowed. The maritime industry is expected to reopen, with the exception of cruises. Sources told News24 that there was uncertainty whether the risk-adjusted approach of having different districts in different levels would be effective in the metros around the country. \""We said people will just drive to another district for what they can’t get under Level 4,\"" a second source noted. It was argued that having districts close by on different alert levels would be difficult to enforce. Earlier this week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said Gauteng as a whole would move to Level 3 and would not move between levels of the lockdown in a disjointed manner. The technical support team of the NCCC, known as Natjoints, is expected to finalise this in the coming days. Mkhize’s plan for the next phase of the government’s response to curbing the spread of Covid-19 includes a ward-based response, which will see people being employed to enforce mask wearing and social distancing, while others would screen people in wards across the country. The NCCC is expected to meet again next Tuesday and, in the meantime, the agreed upon regulations are being finalised by the relevant departments.

This will allow every school sufficient time to implement a \""Roadmap to Reopening\"" – a checklist of prerequisites that must be satisfied before any school is declared safe to reopen.\"" He criticised Motshekga for seemingly neglecting to consider the rights of children during this uncertain period. \""Section 28(2) of our Constitution states that \""a child’s best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child\"".

The woman opened a case of rape against the bishop at the Booysens police station last week Friday and the docket was transferred to the Evaton police station for investigation. In a police statement, which Sunday World has seen, the 46-year-old woman, who now lives in De Deur, alleged that Zondo, who was 14 years old then, plundered her at her grandmother’s house in Sebokeng, south of Joburg, in 1980 when she was just six years old. Relating the ordeal, the woman said she was living with her grandmother Alina Zondo in May 1980. She said her grandmother, who was preggies at the time, went to her parent’s place when she was suffering from pregnancy-related complications, leaving her under the care of Zondo.

France closed its school and higher education institutes from March 17 as part of the country’s measures to contain the country’s coronavirus outbreak. France had recorded over 180,000 cases and more than 28,000 deaths as of May 18. After two months of lockdown, France has begun to lift restrictions, including the reopening of some shops and preschools and elementary schools. According to France24, classes have been capped at 10 students for preschools and 15 students for other age groups. Despite social distancing measures in classes, some kids have caught the disease. Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told French radio station RTL on Monday that 70 new cases of Covid-19 had been detected in the week since students came back, which he said was \""inevitable.\"" \""It’s inevitable this sort of thing will happen,\"" he said. \""In almost all cases, this [transmission] has happened outside of the school.\"" Blanquer noted that the 70 cases were a small proportion of the 1.4 million schoolchildren who have returned.

Denmark became the first European country to reopen schools last month, prompting parents to raise concerns that their children were being used as \""guinea pigs\"" to test government policies. Still, European officials have downplayed the risks of sending kids back to school, saying that the alternative would be more harmful to students in the long run. \""There will be terrible damage if we lose a generation of children who have been stopped from going to school for several months,\"" Blanquer said, according to The Guardian.

Earlier this week, Buyelekhaya caused a stir when he disowned his son, acting king Azenathi Dalindyebo, and suggested that a DNA test be conducted to prove that Azenathi was really his child. This marks an all-time low in their relationship and the culmination of tensions between them which had built up following the senior monarch’s release from jail in December. Since then, the two have been locked in a tussle for the throne. Azenathi had been appointed as acting king from the time Buyelekhaya was sentenced to a 12-year prison term for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was incarcerated in December 2015. Azenathi was installed as acting king by the abaThembu in November 2016. This was officially recognised by government in February 2017. Although Buyelekhaya had initially wanted Azenathi to act as regent when he went to jail, he changed his mind prior to his incarceration and endorsed one of his wives, Queen Nokwanda, to take over. \""NOW THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHEN HE HAS IMPREGNATED A WOMAN, TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN IN FUTURE AND [HAVING] OUR KINGDOM EMBARRASSED LIKE THIS, WE WANT THE KING TO SUBJECT ALL SIX OF HIS CHILDREN TO A DNA TEST\""_ Nkosi Thandisizwe Mtirara However, the amaDlomo (the core royal family) had already accepted Azenathi and argued that, as the king’s eldest son, he was the rightful person to take over. Now, following Buyelekhaya’s release from prison in December, after a remission of sentence was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the two remain locked in a tug of war over who the legitimate king is. This week, presumably frustrated at seeing his son continuing to enjoy all the benefits that come with being acting king, Buyelekhaya threw a spanner in the works by claiming that Azenathi was not his biological child. He demanded that the acting king undergo DNA testing and told him to vacate the royal residence at Bumbane Great Place, near Mthatha. This is not the first time the king has demanded his son leave the royal palace. In March, City Press reported that Buyelekhaya stormed Bumbane Great Place in the middle of the night and allegedly chased away the acting king and his wife. He was arrested the following day and appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates’ Court, where he was released on a warning. He is due to appear in court again on June 1. On Friday, responding on Azenathi’s behalf, the amaDlomo royal family said he would agree to go for a DNA test on condition that all six of the children fathered by Buyelekhaya and his three wives also did so. The family said this was to prevent a future situation in which the king could disown one of his children. \""WE ARE NOT SHAKING OR WAVERING ON THE FACT THAT HE IS OUR SON\""_ Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo, Buyelekhaya’s younger brother and Azenathi’s uncle Addressing a media briefing at Bumbane Great Place, Nkosi Thandisizwe Mtirara said of Buyelekhaya: \""Now that he does not know when he has impregnated a woman, to prevent this from happening again in future and [having] our kingdom embarrassed like this, we want the king to subject all six of his children to a DNA test. \""As the royal family, we are going to monitor that and make sure it is carried through.\"" Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo, Buyelekhaya’s younger brother and Azenathi’s uncle, who supports the acting king, said it was unfortunate that the Thembu nation was still involved in \""a media circus as a result of poverty thinking\"", adding that this was undermining the existence of the kingship as an institution. He said it was unnecessary for Azenathi to be disowned by his father. \""But we are not surprised because this is something that Zwelibanzi [Buyelekhaya] has been using throughout his reign as a weapon of fighting. \""Within the family, we have come to know that when there are issues, our legitimacy in the lineage of Dalindyebo will be questioned. It is time that this stopped. Here we are, faced with maintaining the legacy and dignity of King Thembu himself, the founder of the kingdom,\"" he said. The prince added that such tendencies sowed divisions within the nation, and this would not be allowed to continue unabated. \""Zanelizwe [Azenathi], we are not shaking or wavering on the fact that he is our son,\"" he said. He said Buyelekhaya had not raised any issues with the relevant structures within the abaThembu nation before hanging his \""dirty linen\"" in public. Siganeko praised Azenathi for having brought stability to the amaThembu in the three years, and counting, that he had been at the helm, adding that the abaThembu must continue to develop. \""IF AZENATHI IS STILL GETTING SOME BENEFITS FROM GOVERNMENT, THAT WOULD BE CORRUPTION – BECAUSE HIS CONTRACT AS ACTING KING EXPIRED ON MARCH\""_ Babalo Papu, Buyelekhaya’s spokesperson \""We also explain that Zanelizwe is intact and is in high spirits, happy and jovial. This whole thing has not bothered him. He is just concerned that his dignity and image are being dragged through the mud. \""This is something that we also do not want. We are not about causing a rift between father and son, but that is what his [Buyelekhaya’s] clique and cabal are doing. Our duty is to unite the house of Dalindyebo,\"" he said. He said talks between Buyelekhaya and the amaDlomo royal family had collapsed. Babalo Papu, Buyelekhaya’s spokesperson and confidante, said the king still held a certificate of recognition for the kingdom of abaThembu, and this had never been revoked. He said that there was only one king of the Thembu nation and that Azenathi’s term as acting regent had lapsed in March. Papu said Azenathi had no business occupying the king’s seat or deriving any of the benefits that were due to Buyelekhaya. \""The ruling king currently is king Zwelibanzi Dalindyebo; there is no doubt about that. If Azenathi is still getting some benefits from government, that would be corruption – because his contract as acting king expired on March 8. That means anything that goes to him from government is corruption and needs to be looked into by law enforcement,\"" said Papu. He said the king did not have a problem with all of his children undergoing DNA testing, but he wanted Azenathi’s test to be done as a matter of urgency.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2020/05/17/the-royal-family-wants-all-six-of-king-buyelekhaya-dalindyebos-children-to-undergo-paternity-tests/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

This has prompted the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) to clarify the category of people who do qualify for the grant. Sassa CEO Totsie Memela said on Monday that only people who were unemployed and not benefiting from any other government grant were eligible. Of the 91,000 people who had applied on the WhatsApp line for the Covid-19 unemployment grant, 11,000 were found to be recipients of other social grants and were disqualified, said Memela. Of the 250,000 who applied via e-mail, half were flagged and removed as they already received social grants. From midday on Monday, Sassa launched a new application system to ensure that only those eligible would receive assistance and to stop chancers from defrauding the system. Here are the criteria for the grant: Any unemployed South African older than 18. Must not be a recipient of other social grants, including old age, child support or disability grants. Applicants should not be earning any sort of income. Recipients of NSFAS funding do not qualify. Prisoners and all other beneficiaries of state-funded welfare do not qualify. Memela said those who qualify must be able to produce their SA identity document details in full as well as their gender and disability, if any. The provision of physical address details, even without proof of residence, was also required. Since the lockdown was announced, humanitarian organisation Scientology Volunteer Ministers has sanitised the equivalent of 658 football fields in Gauteng to protect South Africans from the pandemic. The group works tirelessly to decontaminate buildings and vehicles used by the public. To date the group has decontaminated over 3 million square metres.

In a statement on Friday, the Presidency said the parole dispensation would apply to low-risk inmates who have already served their minimum sentence, or who would approach this period in the next five years. Prisoners affected by this decision will not be pardoned or have their sentences remitted, instead, they will be placed on parole and will continue to serve their sentence under community corrections until they reach their respective sentence expiry dates. Some prisoners at Port Elizabeth’s St Albans Maximum Prison set alight objects at the prison this week demanding cigarettes and court dates as lockdown regulations take its toll. \""This dispensation excludes inmates sentenced to life imprisonment or serving terms for specified other serious crimes, including sexual offences, murder and attempted murder, gender-based violence and child abuse,\"" the statement reads. The decision by the president could relieve correctional facilities of just under 19 000 inmates out of a population of 155 000, according to the Presidency. The Presidency further explained that these parolees may be rearrested and ultimately reincarcerated if they violate their release conditions. \""The placement of qualifying sentenced offenders will take place over a 10-week period and will commence as soon as all Parole Board processes have been finalised and all relevant rehabilitation and pre-release programmes are attended. \""The President has taken this decision in terms of Section 82(1)(a) of the Correctional Services Act of 1998 which empowers the President to authorise at any time the placement on correctional supervision or parole of any sentenced prisoner, subject to conditions that may be recommended by the Correctional Supervision and Parole Board,\"" the statement reads.

The municipality paid R50 apiece for surgical face masks, which normally sell for less than R20. The company awarded this work was IC Bane Trading, a company that, according to the government database, is owned by Nombulelo Mantini, a politically well-connected businesswoman. DispatchLIVE received the information from a source who said the municipality had accepted what they knew \""was not right\"". \""We have seen things happening but this is total theft and the sanitisers were way too expensive. This is what the ministers have warned about, the Covid-19 corruption. I leaked these documents for the province to know how bad this is,\"" said the politician, who wanted to remain anonymous. DispatchLIVE managed to verify the source of the documents and Mantini confirmed her company had supplied the municipality with sanitising items at the amounts charged. Her company invoiced the district municipality more than R175,000 for 500 bottles of sanitiser, 1,000 pairs of gloves, 1,000 units of soap, 500 masks, 100 buckets with a tip tap and 120 20-litre containers with tip taps. These items were invoiced to the municipality as follows: Sanitiser 500ml @ R175,00 Gloves @ R4,48 Lifebuoy soap @ R17,49 Masks @ R50,00 Bucket with tip tap @ R126,00 20-litre container with tip tap @ R140,00 The company was paid R87,500 for 500 sanitisers and R25,000 for 500 masks, among other items. Asked if her goods were overpriced, Mantini said she was not privy to the quotations submitted by other companies. \""I cannot answer your question regarding quotes — that would be for the municipality to respond to. However I can respond regarding my pricing, which I consider reasonable,\"" she said. She explained the reasons for her prices: \""First, the sanitisers had to be bottled and the packaging is sourced from Durban. Given the period when this was required, the urgency with which those were needed among other things, one had to travel to fetch the goods from Durban, as opposed to merely ordering and receiving by courier. Secondly, other factors considered in my pricing were that prices had gone up from the supplier due to scarcity of alcohol in the country.\"" She said prices for similarly sized sanitiser bottles ranged between R145 and R175. \""So once again I believe that taking into consideration the above factors, my pricing was reasonable.\"" Chris Hani district municipal manager Gcobani Mashiyi said the municipality had followed supply chain management regulations. After the proclamation of a national disaster, National Treasury had stipulated procurement regulations during the Covid-19 period. He said the value of the products could never be compared to that of the lives that had to be saved. \""The municipality had to swiftly act to avoid a serious and unexpected situation that posed an immediate risk to health and life of CHDM citizens and its employees,\"" said Mashiyi. \""Among the service providers that were considered, the one that quoted at R175 including delivery was awarded. This decision was informed by the urgent need for sanitisers to ensure safety of staff and all our areas of operation throughout the district.\"" However, some local business owners in the district complained about the \""rip-off\"". Komani businessman Siyabulela Qwalela said it was disappointing to see companies charging big money for something that could be bought and manufactured locally. \""The normal price for that size of sanitiser bottle is R45 to R50. This is a rip-off and the municipality on their IDP says they will use local suppliers but that is not happening,\"" said Qwalela. A local businesswoman sent DispatchLIVE her company’s price list for sanitisers. The woman, who wanted to remain anonymous as she does business with the municipality, said what IC Bane had charged seemed expensive and needed investigation. \""I am selling a litre of sanitiser for R120,00 and I would have sold that 500ml for between R60 and R65 after I’d added my 30% markup. Normally, this could sell for between R40 and R50. This is corruption because this municipality should have asked other local companies to support (them),\"" said the businesswoman. An East London retailer this week was selling 500ml sanitiser for R98. IC Bane also supplied Covid-19-related goods to the Eastern Cape department of roads and transport. People, according to Mantini, had started spreading rumours that her company had received R26m from the department. \""I have not received payment from the department as yet.

The EFF reached one million followers this week, while the ANC trails behind with 768 500 followers and the DA – with 595 600 followers. The EFF’s closest rival, the ANC, trails by some 230 000 followers. The EFF was founded in July 2013 and the party elected its current leader Julius Malema to lead the party. The party’s Twitter page shows that it joined the platform in November 2012 and the party describes itself on its header on Twitter as the \""SA Government in Waiting\"". Taking to his Facebook account to celebrate reaching the milestone, former party spokesperson and EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, wrote: \""The @EFFSouthAfrica has reached a million supporters. It is the first political party in South Africa to have this population on Twitter. Hasta la Victoria Siempre! #EconomicFreedom in Our Lifetime.\"" The ANC, which joined Twitter in January 2009, has 768 500 followers on Twitter while the Democratic Alliance, the official opposition in the National Assembly, which joined Twitter in March 2009 has 595 600 followers. Political analyst Mighti Jamie said that the EFF’s milestone demonstrated where the future of South Africa’s political landscape lies and that despite this huge following depicting their size it also allows them to control their own narrative in a way that other political parties were not able to. \""One million followers is one million followers and they have a bigger footprint on the digital space than newspapers and some TV stations, so this allows them to be able to circumvent mainstream media for messaging their own stuff. \""That is a useful tool for them moving into the future of South African politics,\"" said Jamie. He said that a party like the ANC has a historical support base of older voters who are not as digital and tech savvy and not on platforms like Twitter, and even though they were smaller on the internet, they remained sizable on the ground. \""The demographic of the future, which is that 20 to 40 year old demographic seems to have been actively captured by the EFF, more so than any other political party. \""This is a demographic that the DA and other parties are also competing for so the fact that the EFF has been able to capture market share on the internet, independent of its political figure head is critical because very few politicians are at the one million level,\"" Jamie said. He said reaching one million Twitter followers showed that the EFF, as a brand, had proven itself and even established a powerful digital corporate identity. \""Even though the internet is not real life people often ignore that certain demographics are very active on those platforms and quite accurately reflected on those platforms, if we even go a bit lower and you’re looking between the ages of 15 and 40, a large part of the youth demographic is very active on Twitter. \""The fact that the EFF has been able to become the winner in terms of the digital constituency on Twitter gives a stronger indicator of where they’re going in the future,\"" said Jamie. He added that this followership that the EFF has, may even be lower than their actual membership numbers because some people were afraid to follow the EFF because it reflected on their employers’ checks, so it may very well be that they have more support.

Mandisa has also resigned as the red beret brigade’s caucus leader in the Gauteng provincial legislature and as a member of the legislature. The well-known leader is now an unemployed ordinary member of the EFF. Mandisa’s resignations from her leadership position and plum job are akin to the exit strategy used by musician Benny Mayengani. Mayengani first resigned from his job as EFF councillor in the City of Johannesburg last year after complaining that the party leadership chose his fellow artist Ringo Madlingozi over him to become one of the party’s 45 members of parliament. Mayengani later resigned from the EFF and was unveiled as an ANC member by Limpopo premier and ANC provincial chairman Stan Mathabatha during the party’s January 8 celebrations in Limpopo. Mashego’s shocking resignation was revealed by two Gauteng EFF members who did not want to be named because they are not allowed to speak to the media. \""She resigned on Monday. The resignation letter, which is two pages, was sent to our secretary-general Marshall Dlamini and commander-in-chief Julius Malema on Monday,\"" said the EFF member. The other member also confirmed Mashego’s resignation. \""The leadership has accepted her resignation with open hands. We know this is the same modus operandi used by Benny. We are expecting her to resign as a member and leave the party in the not-so-distant future.\"" The member also said the resignation is likely to send Gauteng EFF into a special provincial conference or early conference to elect a replacement for Mashego. Mashego first hinted to her supporters about her planned exit when she removed all her personal belongings from her legislature office three weeks ago amid simmering tension with Malema. So serious had been the tensions that Mashego didn’t even accompany Malema and former party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to Parktown Boys’ High pupil Enoch Mpianzi’s funeral in Joburg a few weeks ago. The member said Mashego’s resignations were precipitated largely by a tweet posted by Malema last month in which he told former Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba that he was aware that two of his provincial chairpersons were talking to him in a bid to join Mashaba’s new party. Malema encouraged Mashaba to expedite the negotiations with the chairpersons, whom he did not name, so that they could swiftly leave the party. \""I’m told one or two of my provincial chairpersons, one from the inland province and one from the coastal province, are also speaking to you. Please speed up the process,\"" read the tweet. The members said Mashego took umbrage at Malema’s tweet as she construed it to mean that she and EFF Kwazulu-natal leader Vusi Khoza were talking to Mashaba. Mashego was the only inland EFF leader who didn’t support Malema’s #matorokisi slate at the party’s elective conference in December while Khoza also did not toe the party leader’s line. Mashego’s faction wanted her to be secretary-general but was pipped to the post by Dlamini. Mashego declined to comment.

In court on Tuesday, the State asked Judge Dhaya Pillay to issue an arrest warrant for Zuma after his legal team applied for him to be absent from proceedings in Pietermaritzburg, citing ill health. Zuma’s legal team submitted documents to the court, saying the former president was ill and had not been in the country since January 23.

The State also raised questions over Zuma’s medical note submitted to the court. Attorney Dan Mantsha, for Zuma, said his health matter was one of national security, and that his doctor was attached to the military. \""It is absurd for the State to doubt admissibility of the medical note stamped by our own military official,\"" Mantsha said.

Downer said the State had been made aware of the former president’s absence from Tuesday’s hearing in good time, but follow-up correspondence to his lawyer Daniel Mantsha regarding a medical certificate and the nature of Zuma’s illness had received no response. Downer said the warrant could be issued but the actual arrest left pending until the court had undertaken an investigation into Zuma’s absence. \""Zuma’s absence is disappointing, we want Mr Mantsha to tell us what the illness is and why Zuma can’t be here.

He asked that the warrant be issued at the end of Tuesday’s proceedings. Downer also said that if Zuma chose to speak of his illness in closed proceedings, the State would not object.

The party also has also committed to ensuring that textbooks are delivered by the department of basic education (DBE) on time. “EFF branches must work with school principals and teachers to ensure that learning material is delivered on time by the department of education. Where there are no books, the EFF structures must raise it sharply with the department until books are delivered.” The party also wants to “take direct action” against the department over schools where pit toilets are still used. The party says this action will continue until pit toilets are replaced. “No parent takes their child to die in our schools.” The EFF is also seeking to “protect our schools from agent provocateurs, criminals and other reactionary forces”. “Learning must commence in safe, orderly and resourced schools. We must support all efforts for this to be achieved.” The party has called on its student command to offer the same “help” at universities. “Let no child be turned away because of finance; let the doors of learning be open to an African child.” The statement concludes with the EFF telling young South Africans to stay in school. “Whoever discourages you from going to school is the enemy of your beautiful future.

The Capricorn TVET College student was brutally murdered about 2.30 on Sunday morning. National police spokesperson Brig Vishnu Naidoo said the man was arrested at his parental home in Nyakelang Village, Botlokwa, on Thursday morning. He was arrested after an operation involving crime intelligence, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks) and forensic and detective services, according to police. “We are confident that we have the right suspect in custody and that he has a case to answer to. The investigating team must be applauded for speedily apprehending the suspect,” said MEC for transport and community safety Namane Dickson Masemola.

A cabinet reshuffle is believed to be in the works as President Cyril Ramaphosa struggles to implement his desired reforms amid push-back from certain factions within the African National Congress (ANC). According to a report in the Mail & Guardian, sources told the publication that Ramaphosa is considering moving Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu to the public service and administration ministry, which is considered less important. This following reports that she is planning to attempt to replace David ‘DD’ Mabuza as ANC deputy president. According to the publication, however, choosing to replace Sisulu could isolate the president from certain ANC structures, especially due to her familial ties to struggle icons Walter and Albertina Sisulu. The M&G further reports that if the reshuffle does take place, it will likely be under the guise of filling vacant positions, such as that of the deputy minister of mineral resources. “When the president has decided to fill the vacant position of the deputy minister of mineral resources and energy, he will communicate his intentions and decision to the public,” was all presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko would say. A Mail & Guardian report released last Friday exposed an anonymous complaint sent to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane alleging that Sisulu is plotting to replace Mabuza. This is similar to claims made in a Sunday Independent article back in May that certain ANC groupings wanted either Sisulu or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to replace the deputy president. The recent M&G report said the complaint to the public protector accused Sisulu of appointing loyalists to her ministry as part of building a campaign to replace Mabuza. One of these appointments is believed to be that of Bathabile Dlamini, who was announced on Friday as the new chairperson of the interim board of the social housing regulatory authority. Sisulu’s spokesperson, Makhosini Mgitywa, said in an interview on eNCA the complaint was “push-back” from those wishing to derail the important work she was doing in her department. News24 editor-in-chief Adriaan Basson incurred Sisulu’s wrath when he wrote a column following the elections in May titled “Ramaphosa’s three biggest challenges right now“, outlining the alleged hurdles Ramaphosa will face in the coming months as “the Zuma camp regroups to undermine and ultimately unseat him”. Basson referenced the Sunday Independent article and cited an allegedly “strained” relationship between Sisulu and the president. “There are different versions of the back story to this, but one theory in the ANC is that Magashule and co are betting on Sisulu’s blind ambition to become president to unseat Ramaphosa. It is no secret that the relationship between Ramaphosa and Sisulu has been strained. Do not be surprised if she does not make it back to Cabinet,” added Basson at the time. Sisulu slammed the column as “fictitious so-called theories on the ANC leadership” on Twitter, adding that “his theory is gathered from fake news and rumours meant to spread discord in the ANC”. Basson defended his right to express his opinion on political developments.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/11/22/president-cyril-ramaphosa-plotting-to-get-rid-of-sisulu-in-reshuffle-report/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

She can do whatever she wants.” John said he doesn’t take himself too seriously and, to show support for Sho, posted her picture on his Instagram account to acknowledge her and her work. “WWE kind of wanted me to issue a statement about it, but I didn’t want to take away her efforts and I didn’t want to make it about me. So I posted a picture of her basically saying I see you and I won’t interrupt your flow here.

Mashaba’s decision comes in the wake of former DA leader, Helen Zille, winning the bid to become the party’s federal chairperson this weekend. “I’m gravely concerned that the DA I signed up to, is no longer the DA that emerged from the weekend,” Mashaba said in a media statement on Monday. “The election of Helen Zille as federal chair is a victory for those within the DA who stand opposed to the principles I stand for. I cannot reconcile myself with people who see race as irrelevant in the discussion of inequality and poverty in South Africa in 2019.” The position of federal chair is akin to the role of a CEO in a company, or the secretary-general of a political party, and is said to be the second-highest political position in a party after the leader. Zille’s return to the higher ranks of the DA follows many years of controversy – particularly over her social media posts – and conflict with senior party leaders, including Mmusi Maimane. Ahead of the DA’s federal chair vote on the weekend, several reports citing ‘party insiders’ speculated the Mashaba would hand in his resignation should Zille gain the position.

"{""published_date"": ""","OCTOBER 1, 2019",""",""title"": """,Ramaphosa reversed the appointments of senior advocates who were appointed by Jacob Zuma.,""",""text"": ""","President Cyril Ramaphosa is being taken to task for reversing the promotion of senior prosecutors who were given new jobs in the dying days of former president Jacob Zuma’s tenure. In a move that is seen as being driven by political considerations, Ramaphosa revoked the appointments of five top National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials whose elevation had been recommended by former national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams and signed off by Zuma in February last year. Ramaphosa claims the appointments were not “finalised” and could therefore be revoked. Now one of the prosecutors is spearheading a court challenge against Ramaphosa. Advocate Ron Mncwabe, who was due to start his new job as Northern Cape director of public prosecutions on February 12 last year, says he finds it “insulting” that, after 22 years of experience in the legal profession, his career progression has been frustrated by factional battles in the ANC. He also contests that the legislative provision Ramaphosa relied on to execute the reversal granted him those powers. ZUMA WRANGLING STALLS OCCUPATION Mncwabe, who is currently working as an additional magistrate at the Tsakane Magistrate’s Court on the East Rand, states in court papers that, despite getting the nod to become the head of prosecutions in the Northern Cape, he didn’t start the job because the “political climate” was uncertain.MNCWABE’S 13-MONTH WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE STARTING DATE OF HIS NEW JOB IN KIMBERLEY ENDED IN DISAPPOINTMENT IN MARCH Other appointments affected were that of director of public prosecutions for Mpumalanga (Advocate Raymond Mathenjwa), director of public prosecutions for the Free State (Advocate Malini Govender), special director of public prosecutions for the priority crimes litigation unit (Advocate Jacobus Pretorius) and special director of public prosecutions for the sexual offences and community affairs unit (Advocate Bonnie Currie-Gamwo). Govender and Currie-Gamwo are not challenging the reversal of their appointments, and Mathenjwa and Pretorius have lodged separate challenges against the decision. Mncwabe’s 13-month wait for confirmation of the starting date of his new job in Kimberley ended in disappointment in March, when the presidency informed him that Ramaphosa had a different view. Mncwabe stated that Abrahams, after receiving Zuma’s confirmation of the appointment, called to congratulate him and sent him a copy of the decision via WhatsApp. Abrahams subsequently sent a hard copy of Zuma’s Presidential Minute to him by hand delivery through his personal assistant. “I immediately accepted the appointment over the phone as well as by email as I saw no reason not to – this was a formal consultation by Abrahams as the head of the NPA, and this was a call for me to continue serving our people at another level,” he said. On February 7 last year, he had a conference call with Abrahams and colleague Advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi, during which “both again congratulated me on my then recent appointment”. However, due to Zuma’s resignation, the implementation of the decision, among many others, was put on hold until there was certainty in the country. What followed was 13 frustrating months of trying to get answers. I AM INSULTED Mncwabe, who describes himself as open-minded, told City Press on Thursday that the answer to the puzzle of his delayed confirmation emerged when a news story last week lumped him in with a faction that propped up Zuma and is apparently now opposed to Ramaphosa’s anticorruption crusade. He said being described as a lackey for any politician was “an insult”.I FIND IT INSULTING TO BE LABELLED A ZUMA PERSON BECAUSE I AM JUST A JURIST PRACTISING LAW IN SOUTH AFRICAMncwabe He added that the allegation that he was “captured by Zuma cannot be supported”, and there was “no evidence that I ever acted in my career in a manner showing that I was captured by any individual. I wish that President Ramaphosa had sat down with me and had a discussion. He would then have known that I have never gone to court and made any decision in support of or against anyone when it is unjustifiable to do so.” FROM PILLAR TO POST According to email records, 10 days after Zuma resigned as head of state and Ramaphosa took the reins, Mncwabe wrote to Abrahams to ask when he would start his new job. After months of no answers, he escalated the query to former justice and constitutional development minister Michael Masutha, and eventually to Ramaphosa in March. He said he was expected to officially start his new job on February 12 last year, but learnt about two hours after the conference call with Abrahams and Mzinyathi that, in light of the political uncertainty in the country at that time, it would be best to let the dust settle before “formal implementation”. In an email to Masutha in October last year, he said he and his colleagues “have been waiting since then”. “For obvious reasons, we continued to enquire about this long delay, communicating with the office of the former NDPP, and continuing to enquire to the acting NDPP,” he wrote.MY OFFICE AS WELL AS MY FAMILY ARE ALWAYS ASKING ME FOR ANSWERS, WHICH I DO NOT HAVEMncwabe He then decided to approach Ramaphosa’s office for intervention. He later learnt that, on March 11 this year, Ramaphosa was revoking his appointment. This instruction was communicated two days later to current NDPP Shamila Batohi for implementation. According to Business Day, the nonfinalisation of Pretorius’ appointment may have had to do with his role in the decision to prosecute then finance minister Pravin Gordhan over the early retirement granted to then SA Revenue Service deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. That decision was reversed by Abrahams two weeks after he had made it. ‘APPOINTMENT NOT FINALISED’ In his Presidential Minute 69, dated March 11 2019, Ramaphosa cites section 13(1)a and section 101 of the Constitution as the legal instruments he relied on when making the decision to revoke Mncwabe’s appointment. Section 13(1)a of the NPA act deals specifically with the appointment of directors and acting directors of prosecutions and, according to Mncwabe, makes no provision as a legal instrument to reverse his appointment. Section 101 of the Constitution regulates executive decisions, providing that “a decision made by the president must be in writing if it (a) is taken in terms of legislation or (b) has legal consequences”. In replying court papers, Presidency Director-General Cassius Lubisi said the fact that there were no formal records available of Zuma’s decision being processed to Masutha for implementation, and that the decision was not communicated privately or publicly to the appointees, means the appointment was not final. He says this means the appointment did not satisfy section 101 of the Constitution and was therefore not finalised. But Mncwabe contests that the Presidential Minute in itself constituted a formal written record and therefore satisfied the requirements of section 101. ‘THE EMAILS STOPPED WORKING’ Explaining the possible reasons behind the matter not being finalised at the time, Lubisi said that “in or about early February 2018, the emails of the presidency stopped working. As such, there is no record of the Presidential Minute having been emailed back to the department. “It is possible that hard copies were collected by officials in the justice department, however, there is no formal record in the presidency showing how [if at all] the minutes may have been transmitted to the department.” He said Abrahams informally passed Zuma’s decision on to Mncwabe because “it is highly unusual for appointees of the president to be furnished with the Presidential Minute, which is an internal formal record of the president’s decisions. It is not ordinarily released into the public domain,” he said. Lubisi added that, while Zuma’s decisions to make the “appointments” were duly minuted, signed and countersigned when he left office, “news of Zuma’s decisions might have leaked [as] neither he nor the presidency ever officially informed the appointees of their appointment, whether by private notice or public announcement”. LAMOLA JOINS RAMAPHOSA According to his office, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola has also filed a notice of opposition, and “the state attorney is in the process of acquiring legal counsel”. “This application concerns an administrative action in the presidency … The minister’s decision to oppose stems from the fact that the NPA needs to be equipped to be effective and operational.” The NPA referred to “papers filed in court”. However, the president, Lamola and the NPA have some hurdles to jump over. First, Ramaphosa will have to tell the court why he filed opposing papers almost five months late – when he filed the papers, the matter had already been enrolled on the unopposed court roll and was scheduled to be heard on January 20. His reasons include the preparations for the May 8 general elections and consultations with Lamola as the new minister of justice. Lamola will also have to explain his late filing. By next month, the court is expected to decide whether Ramaphosa’s reasons for the condonation of delayed filing of papers were valid. However, the application would no longer be listed on the unopposed court roll and a new date for the hearing would have to be determined. Mncwabe hopes this matter will be treated as urgent.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/10/01/ramaphosa-reversed-the-appointments-of-senior-advocates-who-were-selected-by-jacob-zuma/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

In July, the North Gauteng High Court suspended Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s sanction of him following her report accusing him of violating the constitution through his involvement in the so-called “rogue unit”. Gordhan welcomed the judgment at the time and and reiterated that he believes her to be unfit for her post. In a statement, the minister said he “doubts the competence, integrity, legal literacy and constitutional grasp of its incumbent, of her powers, duties and functions.” The statement said the ruling by Judge Sulet Potterill confirmed that Mkhwebane had failed to explain the special circumstances she relied on to entertain a complaint on a matter that happened more than two years ago, as required by the legislation governing her office.

He had the tyres replaced, serviced the car and fixed a faulty radio. This is according to former Crime Intelligence officer Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo who said he met Munusamy “about two or three times” in 2008 to facilitate repairs to her car. Naidoo, who is currently in witness protection, told the commission he was acting on former Crime Intelligence boss Mulangi Mphego’s instructions. He was testifying about his knowledge of journalists who were working closely with Crime Intelligence at the time. He did not name other journalists in his testimony Monday morning. “The third instance I know of, is a female journalist Ranjeni Munusamy. In this instance, I have more detail because I was personally involved. “During 2008, I was called by Mphego to his office. He said he has this contact, her name is Jenny, and she is having problems with her vehicle and I must make contact with her and see how we can help her. I went to (Solomon Lazarus’s) office and explained what was required of me,” he said. “I can’t recall if Lazarus explained to me who this person was but I can confirm it was indeed Munusamy who I met. I met her on two or three occasions. Lazarus told me I should take the vehicle to New World Motors. It is a service provider to Company X [a company used as a front for Crime Intelligence].” He said he met Munusamy at an Engen garage not far from her house. “She handed over the keys and I took the car to New World Motors. The tyres on that specific vehicle was replaced, it was serviced, the radio was faulty, and one of the seats on the car needed some attention,” he said. His testimony will continue after the tea break. Two weeks ago, the Zondo commission heard testimony by Hawks officer Col Kobus Roelofse, who claimed Munusamy’s car had been paid off with money from a secret Crime Intelligence slush fund in 2008. Munusamy has denied the allegations. Tiso Blackstar Group, which owns the Sunday Times, has placed her on special leave to allow her time to deal with the allegations. The company said in a statement that Munusamy had not been engaged by any of its titles or companies during the period covered by these allegations. She only joined Tiso Blackstar in 2017, from the Daily Maverick. “The company was unaware of any investigation involving Munusamy.

This follows a City Press report two weeks ago that Maimane had declared a R4m house in the Cape Town suburb in a parliamentary register, despite the home never belonging to him. In the report, Maimane apparently did an about-turn and said he rented the house from a friend, identified in the story as business person Wessel Jacobs. Maimane had declared that house, as well as a house in Weltevredenpark in Roodepoort, Gauteng, but the deeds office reportedly stated that he only owned the Roodepoort property. The City Press report led to questions about why Maimane was renting a private home and not living in the parliamentary village. His spokesperson Solly Malatsi told News24 previously that this was due to “security risks”. The Sunday Tribune recently reported that Jacobs had indeed confirmed that Maimane was renting the house, saying “Maimane is renting the property from the company at a market-related monthly rental. He (Maimane) pays the market-related rental as per his agreement with the company.” On Sunday morning, Maimane took to Twitter, seemingly responding to the report in the Sunday Times, as well as an article in Rapport about his use of a rental vehicle paid for by disgraced former Steinhoff chief executive Markus Jooste. In his message, Maimane said, “The smear campaign continues”.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/09/29/senior-da-leaders-are-demanding-answers-from-maimane-on-who-pays-his-rent/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

In Mboweni’s presentation, during the third day of the NEC’s conference in Boksburg, he said growth is faltering and tax revenue has disappointed despite tax hikes, including the VAT increase. In a weak economy, Mboweni said, businesses are struggling to cope with the higher tax burden and South Africa’s lack of competitiveness. He said the outlook for growth has worsened significantly since the February Budget, and that growth is likely to remain below 2% “for at least the next two years”. Weak economic growth “Slow progress to date on structural reforms means growth will remain low,” Mboweni said in his presentation at the NEC, which has been leaked to Fin24. Mboweni said that state-owned enterprises (SOEs), e-tolls, the National Health Insurance and the Road Accident Fund are all placing demands on government finances. He warned that SOEs posed a “massive risk to economic stability and fiscal sustainability”, with Eskom’s total debt now the equivalent to 9% of GDP – the same size as the mining and agriculture sectors combined. In a low growth environment, fiscal choices are become starker, Mboweni warned. A reliance on tax increases, and more government spending (particularly on civil servant wages), will hit growth. “If no corrections occur, in a slow growth environment, we face even greater adjustments in three years’ time.” Mboweni also said that there is a lack of accountability for ministers, and that their performance agreements are based on outcomes that are “poorly conceived”, with “no actions taken against officials or ministers”. In his presentation, he also cast doubt about government’s cluster system. Mboweni defended Treasury’s policy discussion document on growth, released last month, which proposes increased support for exports, agriculture and tourism among many other initiatives. The ANC’s alliance partners, including Cosatu, have attacked the plan. But in his presentation on Sunday, he reiterated many of the more controversial aspects of the plan, including: Selling state-owned companies Mboweni said that government should “stop subsidising inefficient SOCs [state-owned companies] to deliver services more effectively done by someone else and sell SOCs that have no clear public service mandate”. Previously, Mboweni mooted the sale of SAA, as well as Eskom’s coal-fired power stations. He blasted wasteful SOE expenditure, including large overruns on infrastructure projects and very high wages for senior officials. Mboweni said SA’s SOEs have unsustainable revenue models, with “high prices reducing demand and a culture of non-payment becoming entrenched”, and as well as unsustainable cost bases (“wasteful expenditure; large overruns on infrastructure; very high wages for senior officials”) and insufficient accountability (“government not enforcing shareholder discipline; board of governors not appropriate”). Mboweni said that major SOEs are abusing their monopoly position, but there isn’t yet resolution whether more competition or better regulation would help solve it. Curbing collective bargaining Collective bargaining agreements are favouring big business and big labour to the detriment of the unemployed and small business, Mboweni said. Treasury wants small businesses to be exempted from industry wage agreements. Mboweni also warned that the national minimum wage is increasing the cost of doing business in SA. “Global competition for low-skilled work is intensifying and SA’s unskilled labour is expensive.” The bottom end of the labour market is being helped with the minimum wage, while highly skilled workers are getting paid well because of a lack of skills. “However, workers in medium-skilled jobs, the informal sector, [and] technology-sensitive jobs have seen [a] decline in the growth of their real earnings.” Promote high-skilled immigration Mboweni said that high-skilled immigration should be promoted through an “improved immigration framework”. He also suggested the creation of a new National Bureau of Economic Research to improve the quality of policy advice, and confirmed plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/09/29/tito-mboweni-issues-stark-warning-to-anc-nec-sticks-to-plan-to-sell-state-owned-companies/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"
"{""published_date"": ""","SEPTEMBER 29, 2019",""",""title"": """,The SACP is preparing to contest 2021 local government elections on its own,""",""text"": ""","The SACP is considering going it alone in a number of municipalities and wards in the 2021 local government elections, particularly those administrations that have collapsed under the control of its alliance partner, the ANC. The proposal is made in an internal discussion document drafted by the SACP ahead of its special national congress in December. It says the party will not give the ANC another blank cheque in 2021 if it fails to improve governance at municipal level. The party stands firm on not being undermined, and plans to embark on a campaign that would see them become more visible in embattled communities ahead of the 2021 local government elections. The South African Communist Party (SACP) has reiterated its wish to discontinue supporting the ANC. The party first voiced its decision in 2016, which was reiterated in 2017 in light of leaked Gupta emails, which general secretary Blade Nzimande strongly condemned. Nzimande also pushed for the blame to be placed squarely on the shoulders of former president Jacob Zuma and his son Duduzane. Deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila revealed to the Sunday Times on Friday that the party is still considering picking up the slack of municipalities and wards that have failed under the ANC, on its own, if administrative failures at the ANC do not improve. Mapaila said the party cannot be “taken for granted” by the ANC any longer, and will not be observers in the ruling party’s imminent collapse. Not contesting the 2019 elections was a decision made at the party’s 14th National Congress in July 2017, where it faced calls from some of its structures to separate from the ANC. Although it did decide to back the ruling party, it did not dismiss the possibility of the SACP becoming its own separate party in the future. However, this decision is now resurfacing in full force, with Mapaila telling the publication that although the party remains committed and cautiously optimistic to an overhaul of the ANC, it is keeping its options open for the 2021 local government elections and the 2024 general elections, should this not occur. Rejuvenation is key to “hasten the pace of our revolution,” Mapaila explains, adding that the SACP would be able to facilitate in rebuilding the country by bringing said rejuvenation. The party stands firm on not being undermined, and plans to embark on a campaign that would see them become more visible in embattled communities. Mapaila explained that monthly door-to-door “blitzes” focussing on key challenges, such as housing, poverty, the environment and gender-based violence, will assist the party in becoming more involved with its future voters. One municipality that will garner much visibility and community aid initiatives would be the Metsimaholo municipality in the Free State, which is currently being run by SACP mayor Lindiwe Tshongwe, and has been identified as a focus point come 2021. Tshongwe’s tenure, however, is based on a coalition, which is reportedly currently shaky and plagued by no confidence votes, which Mapaila says is because of the mayor’s critical view of corruption, as well as instability within the ruling party. Work still needs to be done to successfully contest the upcoming elections, which depends on the SACP’s ability to contribute to clean government, gain support of a left front, ensure that its community is mobilised, and ideological maturity, Mapaila emphasised. The party has long lost faith in the ANC, making the long-anticipated move to stand on its own purposeful and far more serious than when calls were first made to do so in 2016.

"{""published_date"": ""","SEPTEMBER 28, 2019",""",""title"": """,No indication of money laundering was found on CR17 Campaign Donation,""",""text"": ""","The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), which has become central to the Public Protector’s adverse findings against President Cyril Ramaphosa, did not find any evidence of money laundering related to the president. In July, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament when responding to a question about a R500 000 donation to his 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Mkhwebane recommended that the campaign be investigated for money laundering. But Ramaphosa has taken that report on review and has argued that Mkhwebane overstepped by expanding her investigation from the R500 000 donation to the financing of his entire campaign. READ | Ramaphosa: FIC gave Mkhwebane far more CR17 information than what she requested At the centre of that dispute is the FIC, which gave Mkhwebane information on the bank accounts concerned. Earlier this month, News24 reported that, in court papers, Ramaphosa’s lawyers accused the FIC of acting unlawfully because they allegedly gave Mkhwebane more information than what she needed to investigate the donation. The FIC has now entered the fray directly and, in an affidavit filed at the high court in Johannesburg on Friday, FIC director Xolisile Khanyile denied that the centre had acted unlawfully. Khanyile also said in her affidavit that the FIC had told the Public Protector’s staff that it had not found evidence of money laundering – adding that this was not the FIC’s mandate, nor was this finding in any way conclusive. “The FIC maintains that it, at all times, acted in good faith, entirely neutrally, and in accordance with the FIC’s standard operating practice. The FIC has been at all times scrupulously neutral,” Khanyile said in her affidavit. The FIC wants the court to allow it to intervene in the review application and the matter will be heard on October 3. Khanyile set out a chain of communication with Ramaphosa’s lawyers in which the FIC was accused of obtaining information unlawfully. The FIC then decided that the dispute should be ventilated in court. In her affidavit, Khanyile also said that, in the process of obtaining the information Mkhwebane sought, the FIC encountered a number of “regulatory” reports into the bank accounts in question. This was done in terms of legislation which requires banks and businesses to report suspicious transactions to the FIC. It was on this basis that the FIC expanded the scope of the information it eventually gave to Mkhwebane, Khanyile said. “The FIC denies that it acted unlawfully in providing the information it provided to the Public Protector.” Evidence vs intelligence She added that the FIC does not provide “evidence”, but provides “intelligence” – an issue which is of “fundamental importance”. The FIC provides analysis of the information it provides, and is not just a “post box” for information it receives and passes on, she explained. “The requesters might as well just subpoena the banks and be done with it, … there would be no analysis, no value add provided by the FIC…” she said. After the FIC handed its report to the Public Protector in April, the FIC analyst who compiled it asked via e-mail to see the investigator at the Public Protector on the case, Rodney Mataboge. According to Khanyile, this is a normal step taken to ensure that the recipients of its reports understand the contents thereof. “At that meeting, Mataboge specifically asked for confirmation on whether or not evidence of money laundering was found,” Khanyile said. ‘No indication of money laundering’ “Muller informed him that he could find no indication of money laundering as he could not identify any predicate offence from which the monies could have been proceeds of.” Khanyile said that she wanted to “emphasise” that the FIC does not have investigative powers. “It collects information, interprets and analyses it for the purposes of assisting the legislated entities which have such powers to conduct their own investigations. “In this regard the FIC’s findings on the existence or not of the predicate offence are not conclusive as it did not investigate whether or not such predicate offence existed. The conclusions were solely based on the fact that the amount of R500 000 came from sources that appeared to be lawful,” Khanyile said. She said the Public Protector was “duty bound” to do her own investigations after receiving the FIC report.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/09/28/no-indication-of-money-laundering-was-found-on-cr17-campaign-donation/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

The report said Ramaphosa’s team has asked the centre whether it intends to address the alleged offences committed by the Public Protector. Mkhwebane was in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday to meet with KwaZulu-Natal lawmakers when questions on the new information were put to her. “It is so unfortunate that the same president’s lawyers are litigating through the media and it is a challenge for us as an institution.

But not before saying a small prayer and thanking the Almighty for his release on Monday. Ndlovu, 35, was wrongly convicted of rape and was forced to endure prison life for 13 years until his innocence was eventually confirmed in court last week. When Ndlovu arrived at his home in Umlazi’s J-Section, to his surprise a welcome home celebration had been planned and drew relatives and friends who he’d not interacted with in a long while. “Walking out from that place (Westville Prison) made me feel like I was born again,” Ndlovu said. A full bench of Judges at the Pietermaritzburg High Court overturned his rape conviction and sentence last week. He was among the men accused of gang raping a pregnant woman in 2002. Ndlovu was a student at the University of KwaZulu Natal’s Westville campus at the time. Through the ensuing trial, Ndlovu maintained his innocence. Judge Rashid Vahed who delivered last week’s judgment said DNA evidence had not linked Ndlovu to the crime and raised concerns about the conduct of magistrate Mike Lasich, who convicted him. On his arrival at his Umlazi home, Ndlovu said the smell of braai meat had him drooling even before he could get out of the car. “Family and friends came out in numbers to welcome me. Everyone wanted to find out how I coped all those years in prison. They showed me love. We feasted on braai meat and pap, something I have been longing for for years. “I’m looking forward to more of my mom’s delicious home cooked meals like Jeqe (steam bread) and sugar beans, it’s my favourite,” he said. While being back home was a joyous occasion, there was a time when his emotions got the better of him. His brother Siyabonga who he shared a close bond with and was his biggest supporter during his trial, was not a part of the celebrations. “Siyabonga died in a car accident in 2016 and a year later his wife died, leaving behind their only child. He was always there for me and checked up on me regularly,” said Ndlovu. The death of Siyabonga and Ndlovu’s imprisonment made his parents Mbuso and Makhosazane feel as if they had no children. “I felt lonely and miserable. Whenever I walked on the streets, I could sense people pitied me. Those were very difficult days for me and my family,” said his mother, Makhosazane. Ndlovu said he never lost hope. “I always knew the truth would eventually emerge. Being in prison was tough but I knew I had to survive. Worst of all was the effect it had on my parents. I am grateful that they never gave up on me,” said Ndlovu, who achieved a law degree from Unisa in prison. “There was a time when I hated the law profession especially when I thought how it failed me. My passion for law was driven by my father’s unfair retrenchment from work. I wanted to fight against injustices and make a difference in society,” he said.

Chairperson of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa in Limpopo, Kgoshi Letsiri Phaahla, told Sowetan last week he served notices to at least six foreign shopkeepers in his village, giving them seven days to leave, which they have ignored. Phaahla of GaPhaahla village near Jane Furse said he was approached by concerned residents who raised complaints regarding fake and expired products. Resident Wolf Machika, 62, who was renting his building to a foreign national, alleged that he was assaulted while fighting off the group which wanted to loot a tuckshop. He said the group told him they were sent by Phaahla following a written notice. “The group, most of whom appeared drunk, came and forced their way into my yard on Thursday afternoon. “At that time I had just arrived from fetching firewood from my farm and I had a panga in my hand. I wielded my panga towards them and they ran away,” he said. Machika said the group later returned in numbers and overpowered him. “Some of them held my hands from the back, while others were slapping me. Fortunately, they didn’t break into the shop because it was locked. I’m renting my building out because I want to be able to feed my family. There is nothing wrong with foreign nationals doing businesses,” he said. He accused Phaahla of using a mob to attack business people in the area. “Some of them had confessed that they had been sent by Phaahla, hence I went to police to lay criminal charges against them. I want the police to get to the bottom of this.” Police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe said a case of common assault was opened and no arrests had been made. Machika said he now lives in fear because the mob could return at any time. Phaahla denied Machika’s allegations and said he was approached by the community about fake products sold by foreign nationals in his village. “We held a meeting two weeks ago in which community women who are doing a food stokvel raised complaints that some of their members are refusing to accept products bought in the tuckshops operating in my village. The community said they sell expired food. I then wrote a letter to these foreign nationals notifying them that they have seven days to leave the place,” he said. “On Monday, I issued a verbal notice through my council, giving them [foreign nationals] a day to pack and leave but they still refused. I told them that their safety was no longer guaranteed because community members came to me this week showing frustrations.” Kenny Mathivha, spokesperson for Limpopo premier, condemned Phaahla’s action, saying no one was allowed to chase away people. “We call upon the security cluster to act against people who instigate Afrophobia. As a chief, Phaahla should be playing a unifying role and not divide the community.”",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/09/20/limpopo-chief-evicts-foreign-tuckshop-owners-for-selling-fake-products/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

According to Dr Dirk Hermann, Solidarity Chief Operations Officer, the Sol-Tech campus is world-class and on par with international institutions. “Although our criterium is world-class, our architects succeeded to use a typical South African and specifically Afrikaans design style,” said Paul van Deventer, MD of Sol-Tech. “Traditional architectural styles have been absorbed in the design in a modern way. The layout of the campus acknowledges in a variety of creative ways historical events and dates where artisans played an important role.” Earthworks commenced on Monday (16 September), and the campus is expected to open its doors in January 2021. Solidarity said that its next major project is the construction of the Akademia campus where education will be offered through Afrikaans as the medium of instruction. Projects included in the Solidarity network pipeline include: A comprehensive alternative school system, An occupational training, A university, Financial aid for education, A youth movement, A network of occupational guilds, Mentorships; Job placement; Protection in the workplace; Continued education. How it is being funded Hermann said that the strength of Sol-Tech and of its new campus lies in the fact that it is being built by the community. “Every Solidarity member donates R10 to a Building Fund each month,” he said. “Thousands of members of the public donate smaller amounts each month to make the building of institutions such as Sol-Tech possible. “What we see here is not the product of state money or major empowerment money but of small contributions by the thousands adding up to make something big happen.” Hermann added that the union was calling on people to join the group in working for the huge building projects. “The only way we can ensure a future is to build it ourselves.

Testifying at the commission of inquiry probing state capture on the demise at the SABC, Motsoeneng said his plan had been to “capture” the family, but gave no further explanations as to what he meant by this. He also admitted to meeting the Guptas, and threw in a humorous comment saying their (Guptas’) curry was delicious. Giving further testimony, Motsoeneng maintained that his former boss, SABC chief executive Lulama Mokhobo, had been dishonest in her testimony last week when she claimed that she was unaware that when she visited the Saxonwold compound, it belonged to the family. “She knew where we were going,” Motsoeneng said. Motsoeneng, who worked at the SABC as a journalist and a producer before assuming a senior position, has since established his own political party, the African Content Movement, after he was axed from the public broadcaster. He again used the commission to deny any responsibility for the collapse of the broadcaster, saying those who had hired him two decades ago and later as chief operating officer were well aware that didn’t have a matric certificate. “I was headhunted,” Motsoeneng maintained. He said that it was an insult for people to say he lied about passing matric. The former executive said he was approached by another colleague at the broadcaster by the name of Alvin Kloppers, who was in charge of current affairs and news. He maintained that he had declared from the onset that he did not have his matric, but the SABC put him on a course to learn about broadcasting. Motsoeneng also said he was among the first people in the history of the broadcaster to be put on such a course as it did not put freelancers on the course. Motsoeneng also claimed he went to Pretoria with current SABC foreign editor Sophie Mokoena to check his matric symbols, and further denied that he had been offered the operations officer job despite being unqualified as, in his view, he was very educated and capable, and had the required skills to do the job. He is set to return to the commission on Wednesday to give further evidence. Meanwhile, the SABC on Tuesday admitted that the wrong clip for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation, aired last week Thursday, had been an act of sabotage. In the clip, Ramaphosa is seen speaking briefly and then asking to run his line again. According to the broadcaster, the correct clip was sent to Parliament. In a statement, the SABC said it now had “strong prima facie evidence” that indicated that the action had been well co-ordinated.

These new revelations come after reports last week that the party was unable to pay its staff bonuses this year because of cash-flow problems. The Star has seen a letter dated September 3, 2019, written by DA chief executive Paul Boughey, informing staff members that the party would look into cutting jobs to meet its 2021 local government “elections objectives”, including the organisation’s “financial obligations”. “This is an unfortunate situation, and we acknowledge that this is a difficult time. However, it is as a result of looking at several alternatives to streamlining our operations over the last while that we have reached a decision to embark on a restructuring process,” Boughey wrote. “We will ensure that this process is carried out with the highest level of sensitivity and it will be concluded in a reasonable manner,” he added. Sources close to the DA have revealed that party funders “had started ditching the sinking ship” because of its almost 1.5% drop in support at the May general elections from 2014, which supposedly necessitated the slicing of jobs. It was also claimed that the DA, which apparently had a R400m war chest to fight the election, “squandered” the money through alleged corruption, including one Gauteng field support officer who was apparently robbed twice of R60000 of party funds in separate incidents. “The staff members were informed that the DA will be retrenching them due to party funders pulling out their financial support after the dismal showing by the DA at the May elections. “Mike Moriarty, DA Gauteng provincial chairperson, informed the Gauteng provincial council in June that one field support officer got robbed twice of R60000 on two different occasions. This is an example of how the R400m was misappropriated,” said a source, who asked to remain anonymous. The Star directed questions to the DA’s national leadership, as well as its Gauteng and Mpumalanga structures, where the retrenchment letters were first served. Speaking on their behalf, DA communications director Mabine Seabe said the party had initiated its “organisational review” following the May polls, as is the norm after every election. He neither confirmed nor denied the party’s elections fund amount. Seabe added that to focus on the 2021 local elections, the DA had “to review the resources available to it and align operations accordingly”. “This sensitive matter has been discussed by senior leadership and management, and all political staff are being consulted by the HR department and their line managers. “The discussions are between employer and employee and therefore the specifics will remain private between the parties concerned. This process is in line with our professional and forward-looking approach,” Seabe explained. On allegations of misappropriation of funds, Seabe said the DA operated with the “highest level of professionalism in all that it does”. “Funding, whether from public or private donors, is managed to the highest possible standard. All campaign rand have been accounted for, and where there are outstanding invoices, consequence management has been effected,” Seabe said. @khayakoko88 The Star",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/09/09/d-a-to-retrench-partys-staff-members-as-funders-ditch-a-sinking-ship/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

From the nationwide MMM global social financial network to “WhatsApp group stokvels”, the amount of people who lose large amounts of money is increasing, yet people continue with it and have not learnt their lesson. The WhatsApp group stokvel has an administration person who recruits group members, charging them R200 Once the person has paid the fee they are told to bid an amount they can afford that day. Once the list of bidding money is displayed on the group chat, a name is selected and whoever bids on the amount requested by the number selected for the day, that bidder has to deposit the money into the bank account of the person who requested it and the bidding rolls over to the next day. However, many members have complained about these stokvels saying they haven’t received their money. On Thursday a lady from a group of church members told the Fever she is tired of these stokvels and wants her money. The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, said she deposited money on 16 June into one of the “stokvel” members bank account and was told that in 48 hours she would have the money, plus interest deposited back into her account, however, until now she hasn’t received anything. “I am really disappointed by what is happening in my stokvel group. “The first time I was asked to deposit money I did so and the second time as well and I got the money back on both occasions, but the third time I was told to make a deposit I was given an account number with the name of the stokvel group and not that of an individuals account.” She said she waited for her money to be deposited into her account, but nothing was reflected in her account. “I inquired from admin as to why I had not received my money and they told me I had not made a deposit, so I sent the deposit slips as proof,” she said. It has been a week now and she hasn’t received anything and has even been blocked from the group, and warns people about these WhatsApp stokvels, saying there are not legitimate and people are merely trying to get rich off other people illegally.",""",""url"": """,http://search67.com/2019/09/06/dont-fall-a-victim-of-r200-whatsapp-stokvel-scam/,""",""medium"": ""search67""},"

This is according to Durban high court judge Dhaya Pillay, who on Friday ordered Zuma to remove it and publish an apology on Twitter within 24 hours. Zuma was ordered to pay damages, the quantum of which is to be determined at a future hearing where oral evidence will be led. Hanekom, the former tourism minister – in Zuma’s administration – was suing Zuma for R500,000 in damages after the former president tweeted in July that Hanekom was a “known enemy agent”. Hanekom said this has caused him “immense harm and damage” because it gave the impression that he was an apartheid spy. Zuma, in his affidavit, said there were “common cause events” that demonstrated that Hanekom “colluded with opposition parties that sought to remove me as president”. Judge Pillay also issued an interdict preventing him from ever again stating or implying that Hanekom is an enemy agent or a spy. She said this will not prevent him from giving honest evidence at the Zondo commission. Hanekom’s lawyers were not present.

However, for now, deepest condolences to his family.” Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed the news on Twitter: Educated by Jesuit priests, he became a teacher before joining the liberation struggle. Mugabe, the intellectual — with his many academic degrees — was considered the political leader and the brains behind the guerrilla war, and was imprisoned for 11 years.

The report was conducted to gauge South Africans’ attitudes towards political parties, and their intention to vote. The Afrobarometer team in the country, led by Plus 94 Research, interviewed 1800 adult South Africans in August/September.
