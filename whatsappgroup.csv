The funeral of burying the wrong body costed the family R13 000. This was caused because the family was not allowed to visit their covid19 patient father in hospital. These were the words of a heartbroken Eastern Cape widow who exclusively told News24 that due to a bungle at Uitenhage Provincial Hospital’s mortuary, the body of her 79-year-old husband was mixed up with that of someone else. As a result, she had to organize two funerals in the space of four days this week. Retired nurse Nomsa Noda, 67, who worked at the same hospital where her husband died, said she was shocked when an undertaker, accompanied by her pastor, visited her on Wednesday to tell her she had buried the wrong person. Her husband Vukile Noda, 79, died of Covid-19 on 22 June after he was admitted to the hospital seven days earlier. Noda claimed the mix-up happened when her husband’s name tag was put on the body of another person, who also died of Covid-19. She ended up burying the stranger at a funeral at Matanzima Cemetery in Uitenhage on Sunday. People travelled from across the country to pay their respects on the day. The mourners included her daughter Zuziwe Noda who teaches at a Rustenburg school. \""I did not even have the strength to call all those people or my daughter to tell her the man she came to bid farewell to was not her father. On Thursday, she organized another funeral for her husband and the service was attended by less than 20 people. ‘He could not sleep that night’ \""The second funeral service was too small because 80% of the mourners had already travelled back to their towns of residence, thinking that they had said their goodbyes to my husband. Calling and asking them to return for the right funeral would have been inconsiderate.\"" Noda said the undertaker knew about the bungle at the hospital on the Tuesday already, but did not have the heart to tell her immediately. \""He said he was scared to come immediately. He said he could not sleep that night, so he went to our pastor to tell him the news and they both came to our house on Wednesday. We buried him on Thursday.\"" \""When they came to tell us this, we could not sleep a wink the entire Wednesday night. I am so traumatized by this situation,\"" said Noda. Nyiki Funeral Directors’ owner Zway Nyiki confirmed the incident and slammed the health department for creating \""chaos\"". Counsel the family \""The health department must answer because they are the ones who created this chaos. Yesterday they were doing door-to-door visits, apologising to everyone, including me and the Noda family. They must answer.\"" The pastor from the Church of God and Saints of Christ church, Siphiwo Mangena, said when Nyiki came to him with the news, he prayed and asked God to grant him strength. \""I had to counsel the family… The undertaker was too shocked and scared to break the news alone so we went together.\"" Mangena – who was the only member of the church who could make it to the second funeral on Thursday – said in his 17 years as a pastor, he had never experienced this. Mangena said: I prayed, sang and preached alone in front of the 10 mourners. It was very sad. A more dignified funeral was organised for the wrong person on Sunday. This was a big shock, I have never seen anything like this before. That initial funeral was well planned and had financial implications because the church members pledged and bought bouquets of flowers. The choir was there as well, thinking we were bidding farewell to a senior and respected member of our church. Noda said the mix-up could have been easily avoided. \""Initially they agreed to show us the body prior to the funeral. They said they would allow two people to view the body behind a glass wall at the mortuary. However, that did not happen.\"" Integrity, humility To make matters worse, Noda said the health department never tested her and everyone who stayed with the deceased. She added that a company had to be hired to decontaminate her Luphondwana Street house in Uitenhage’s largest township, Nobuhle. The costs for the initial funeral were R13 000. \""We chose another coffin for the second funeral and were granted another grave.\"" She said they heard that the affected family would will exhume the body she initially buried and rebury it. The Eastern Cape health department condemned the incident. Provincial health department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said: \""This is totally unacceptable and regrettable. Officials should always ensure they serve our people with integrity and humility. We condemn the negligence and there must be consequences by the management.\"" ",""",""url"": """,http://whatsappgroup.co.za/2020/07/04/covid19-body-mix-up-family-buried-a-wrong-body-instead-of-their-father/,""",""medium"": """,whatsappgroup.co.za,"""},"

Some councillors have been criticised for looting food parcels and for distributing food parcels along political lines. According to community activist, Mary de Haas, there are reports elected councillors were handing out food parcels meant for the poor to their families, friends and allies. She said complaints had been received in the KZN Midlands, Pietermaritzburg, Durban, Dannhauser and Nquthu. \""Among those making these allegations are political supporters who are disgusted with what is happening in their communities. These reports suggest that endemic corruption continues to dominate in government, regardless of the consequences. Divisions between the haves and have-nots are exacerbated,\"" she said. De Haas warned the likelihood was high tensions would boil over into overt violence, adding this may trigger further repression by over-stretched security forces. \""All because of the greed and corruption that continues its grip with absolute impunity, people need food to take medication,\"" she added. Congress of South African Trade Unions KZN secretary, Edwin Mkhize said they had also received reports of food parcel corruption. \""In all parts of the province, our comrades are being told about this left and right.

DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said he had to use his own money to purchase food parcels for some residents in Nongoma. \""I wrote to the department of Social Development last week to ask for food parcels for some of the residents in Nongoma, to date, there has been nothing. I had to use my money to buy some for the residents.\"" He said the area is also faced with serious water shortages and he had to arrange for tankers to visit the affected areas. South African National Civic Organisation leader in the Midlands, Fanele Sibisi, said they had received complaints in wards in Msunduzi, Howick, Impendle and Mshwathi municipalities. He said the main complaint was that destitute communities were not getting food parcels and these were rather distributed to friends and comrades. \""There is also a problem with the distribution of water through tankers and jojo tanks but that is not as severe as the issue of food parcels,\"" he said. KZN Department of Social Development spokesperson, Mhlabunzima Memela said the department was aware of the allegations. He said MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called an urgent meeting to intervene. \""We have also heard that there are people that have been excluded by ward councillors from being beneficiaries of food parcels,\"" said Memela. He said they would ask the government’s flagship programme in the province, Operation Sukuma Sakhe and District Team to probe the matter. \""It is against the law. This is help from the government and it’s not political. No one should be excluded regardless of their political affiliation. We just want to ensure that needy communities do not go to sleep with an empty stomach. \""The department will meet with all relevant parties, and we are also calling upon communities to report acts of corruption by contacting the MEC or report to the mayor’s office,\"" he said Memela said those caught in the act would be violating government policy and would face the law.

The ruling party occupies the opposition benches in the City and among the issues it raised, is that the mayor has undermined council resolutions for a month. In a statement released on Wednesday by the party, it claimed Mokgalapa failed to execute a council resolution instructing the City to cut ties with City Manager Moeketsi Mosola. Several other issues they accused the mayor of includes \""the failure to finalise the appointment of James Murphy as acting city manager\"", power outages, corruption and dirty and toxic water supply crisis in Hammanskraal. Newly Released 2019 Top 50 Highest Paid PSL Stars. The vote of no confidence comes at a time when Mokgalapa and the DA leadership are at loggerheads over whether he had party approval to travel to China on a Huawei-sponsored visit in July this year. The mayor and his officials from his office had gone on a paid-for junket to China to view smart cities, courtesy of Huawei. The delegates that left for china included the Tshwane divisional head for private office and ceremonial services, Norman Mohale, MMC for Corporate and Shared Services Richard Moheta, MMC for Health Derrick Kissoonduth, and the group head for shared services, Musa Khumalo. Earlier this month, the DA’s national leadership had deployed members to monitor the City of Tshwane’s performance following a series of gaffes, including the long-running stand-off with Mosola, this effectively placed the City under party administration. On Tuesday, a second independent forensic investigation into the GladAfrica tender scandal was under way. This is the second independent investigation into the project management contract, which saw most of the City’s infrastructure spending outsourced to GladAfrica, a private project management firm. The tender was cancelled by mutual agreement between the City and GladAfrica earlier this year. On Sunday, Mokgalapa denied claims that he was involved in issuing a so-called smart city tender to Huawei. He also denied claims that the deal was worth R1bn.",""",""url"": """,http://www.trendsdaily.co.za/metro-new/mayor-of-tshwane-risks-removal-from-office-as-anc-tables-motion-of-no-confidence/,""",""medium"": """,trendsdaily.co.za,"""},"

In a statement the committee said that currently section 194 (1) of the constitution provides for the removal of the Public Protector on the grounds of misconduct, incapacity or incompetence. Hishaam Mohamed, the Study Group’s Chief Whip added that the constitution also stated that should a committee in parliament find such an adverse finding against the Public Protector then the incumbent would be removed from the Chapter Nine Institution. He said \""However, despite this provision, the constitution does not explicitly state the procedure that should be followed when removing the Public Protector from office. Therefore, it is with this in mind that parliament’s rules committee has been tasked with drafting a set of rules, that will dictate what procedure should be followed when removing the Public Protector, or the head of any Chapter Nine Institution from office.\"" Mohamed added that the Public Protector’s office was a cornerstone of the country’s democracy and it played a crucial role in keeping members of the executive accountable. He said \""We as the ANC’s Study Group on Justice and Correctional Services will ensure that the process is fair, transparent and objective, in line with values and beliefs of South Africa’s constitution.\"" The statement however generated dislikes on the social media handle twitter as many did not take kindly to the statement with many accusing the ANC of selling out and failing to protect Mkhwebane.

This information was revealed in the 2019 Analysis of Corruption Trends Report released by Corruption Watch. Furthermore, the report indicates that for the first time corruption in the police sector has overtaken other sectors like schools, health and local government. According to the report, abuse of power is at 35.7% and bribery is at 30.6% in the police sector. In an earlier report released by Corruption Watch in June, Corruption in Uniform: When Cops Become Criminals focusing only on corruption in the police sector, it was revealed that Gauteng had 52.8% corruption, the highest in the country. The DA has always said that corruption within SAPS must be rooted out as a matter of urgency, in order to create an honest and a professional police service. Trust between residents and the police have broken down because of corruption. Gauteng residents must feel safe in their homes, places of work and on the street. The only way this can be achieved is if there is a good working relationship between residents. Corruption would be easy to get rid of in SAPS if only the good cops are willing to arrest the minority bad element in their midst, however, this begins with good leadership and political will. The DA will continue to call on government to ensure that SAPS is professionalised, corruption is eradicated and that the police competency be given to the province in order to better address local needs.
