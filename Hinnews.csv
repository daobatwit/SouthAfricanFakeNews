According to Ngcukaitobi, a proper reading of the recent ruling shows that Roets was clearly prohibited from displaying the flag. His doing so amounts to a deliberate undermining of the courts for which he should be appropriately punished, Ngcukaitobi further argued. Ngcukaitobi also questioned whether Roets needed to include a picture of the flag in his tweet, which he claimed was an \""academic question\"" and therefore legal according to the new ruling. An urgent application brought by the Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) seeking to hold Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum in contempt of court over Roets’ tweet continues to be heard at the Equality Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday, with advocate Cedric Puckrin acting for AfriForum. Judge Colin Lamont is presiding. Roets tweeted the flag on August 21 along with the question \""Did I just commit hate speech?\"". In another tweet, he argued that his use of the flag was legal as it was for \""academic purposes\"". He is also arguing that he tweeted it in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the organisation. The Equality Act does not protect academic displays of the flag that were made in bad faith, a statement released by the foundation said at the time. On Wednesday morning, Ngcukaitobi argued that anyone who read Roets’ tweet would interpret it as being from AfriForum, as it came from one of its leaders only hours after the judgment. He further argued that the August 21 judgment must be enforced strictly, as it was a declaratory order which constituted more than just advice. Ngcukaitobi said the absence of an interdict did not mean that AfriForum had not committed contempt of court. Judge Lamont asked Ngcukaitobi if Roets’ actions could be considered contempt of court since the display of the flag was not prohibited but only declared hate speech by the ruling. In response, Ngcukaitobi argued that this interpretation would be too technical and narrow, as Roets’ actions deliberately undermined the authority of the judiciary contempt and should therefore legally constitute contempt of court. The application continues to be heard. Judge President Phineas Mojapelo ruled that badly intentioned public displays of the old South African flag, which its detractors often referred to as the \""apartheid flag\"", should be limited, since \""gratuitous display\"" constituted not only hate speech but also harassment, and could be interpreted as an expression of white superiority, divisiveness, and severe racial prejudice.

It’s time to come out of hiding and act, President Ramaphosa",""",""text"": """," The following remarks were delivered today by DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, in Johannesburg. Maimane was joined by representatives from DA-led Gauteng governments, which included Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, Midvaal Mayor, Bongani Baloyi, and Johannesburg MMC for Finance, Funzi Ngobeni (o.b.o Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba). Fellow South Africans We are today a nation in mourning. The news yesterday of the brutal and calculated rape and murder of 19-year-old Uyinene Mrwetyana by a civil servant employed by the state has shocked the collective conscience of our nation. A young girl was subjected to such barbaric and inhumane treatment and had her life cut short while performing a regular errand such as entering a Post Office. Just this past week, 14-year-old Janika Mallo was found dead in her grandmother’s back yard after being raped and murdered. And boxing champion Leighandre \""Baby Lee\"" Jegels, was murdered by her boyfriend – a SAPS employee entrusted to protect citizens. On behalf of the DA, I extend my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of these young women whose lives were taken by cruelty and evil beyond comprehension. These young women were not the first victims of the violence against women that is so prevalent in our society. We’ve been exposed to similar tragedies. From Courtney Peters to Karabo Mokoena, from Valencia Farmer to Meghan Cremer. These are daughters of our nation who ought to be protected from harm, not preyed upon. The sad reality is that unless swift action is taken, these young women won’t be the last victims of such crimes. Official statistics tell us that last year alone, almost 40 000 people were raped in South Africa – the overwhelming majority being women. That’s 109 people raped per day, and those are only the victims who decide to report the crime. We need urgent, clear and decisive action and we cannot wait a moment longer. This goes much further than putting the perpetrators of such heinous acts in jail. It requires addressing the root causes of this social and moral decay and bold leadership making hard, unpopular but effective decisions. I have just moments ago finished a scheduled meeting with the leadership of the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SACCI). Even within the business community, the sentiment is clear: South Africans are scared and lack real hope for the future. Our businesses are shutting down and struggling to create jobs, our young girls are being raped and murdered, and drugs and gangsterism are stealing our young people’s future. South Africans are crying out for leadership in action. We are seeing economic and social collapse in action, and the widespread violent protests, looting, destruction of property and general lawlessness which has taken place over the past weeks and months is evidence of this. This civil unrest reached its peak yesterday where the City of Johannesburg, the City of Tshwane, and large parts of the City of Ekurhuleni were under siege by violent protest action. In this light, we condemn this action in the strongest terms possible and call for the restoration of law and order. Those caught breaking the law must be arrested and prosecuted, and we welcome the arrests already made. But more is required. Therefore, today we call on President Cyril Ramaphosa to come out of hiding and break his silence on the unfolding social and economic crises. Ramaphosa was elected to lead, and each day he remains silent, the situation deteriorates even further. We call on the President to at once: Oversee the accelerated operation of the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS) in every area affected by protests and lawlessness. The NATJOINTS is empowered to coordinate all security and law enforcement operations throughout the country and is best placed to first anticipate and if necessary, to respond timeously to incidents of criminality and disorder when they occur; Instruct the urgent deployment of Public Order Policing to all volatile areas within Gauteng and surrounds; Appear before Parliament to make an urgent statement in the House about what is being done to renew the social contract between the state and citizens given the complete breakdown in trust and social order; Announce an immediate cut to spending on VIP protection for politicians. The VIP protection budget allocation to each individual is approximately R10 million per year, with Ramaphosa’s Cabinet costing R631 million per year in VIP protection. This money must be redirected to capacitating law enforcement agencies to combat and prevent crime; and Establish a special task team to review the systems and processes of law enforcement officials and agencies, the SAPS, and the criminal justice system, with a focus on how to better predict and prevent violent crimes against women. I will also be seeking an urgent update from the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, on what progress, if any, has been made in implementing the findings of Parliament’s Ad Hoc Joint Committee on Probing Violence against Foreign Nationals. This report was finalised and adopted by Parliament on 18 November 2015 – almost four years ago. It is common cause that a significant contributor to our social ills is SAs collapsing economy. Protests, violence and looting are often caused and exacerbated by vast inequality, joblessness, and economic exclusion faced by millions across our country. With over 10 million South Africans unemployed, and half the nation living below the poverty line – we have run out of \""extra time\"". It’s now or never. If we don’t fix our economy we will not fix our broken society. Therefore, it is high time our political differences are put aside as we work together across party lines in order to implement one economic plan that benefits all South Africans. This task begins on Thursday, when Parliament will hold an urgent debate of public importance on South Africa’s jobs crisis following my request. This debate comes at a time when politicians in Parliament need to put the people first and put their words into action. If we don’t deal urgently and decisively with the underlying causes of the upfolding economic and social collapse engulfing our nation, we will have no country left to build. In closing, I would like to call on every church, mosque, synagogue – all religious leaders and South Africans of faith to continuously pray for our nation and its leadership.

The committee resolved to refer the matter back to the Speaker’s office so that the Programming and Rules committee may set down rules to guide the process to be followed by Parliament in this matter.

The police minister wrote to National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise, requesting that the police portfolio committee consider the amended draft declaration for the firearm amnesty. The speaker has however referred the letter to committee because the Firearms Control Act provides for the amnesty to be valid if it is approved by Parliament. In the letter the minister drafted, he noted that a draft notice for a declaration of amnesty was tabled by his predecessor Fikile Mbalula in 2017 and was referred to the police portfolio committee. He also said the committee had required that Mbalula table a new letter containing the new date prior to approval. Cele revealed that the proposed new dates for amnesty would be October this year to March next year. Some of the information in the drafted letter include \""The portfolio committee was unable to consider the draft notice prior to February 1, 2018, being the proposed date on which the amnesty period was set to commence. While I am in support of the declaration of an amnesty on the condition that was in principle already agreed to by the portfolio committee, I further wish to add that an application contemplated in Section 134 (4) of the said Act shall not apply to illegal firearms where documentary proof of previous ownership cannot be produced. \""It will be appreciated if the amended draft notice can be forwarded to the portfolio committee of police for consideration. Cele revealed that the Firearm Control Act required him to publish a notice to declare an amnesty; he said \""The amnesty may result in the reduction of the number of illegally possessed firearms in South Africa. It’s in the public interest to do so.\"" In terms of legislation, the amnesty must specify the period in which people may apply for it as well as the conditions under which it may be granted.

In a statement released on Monday amid the continued looting and burning of foreign-owned shops in Gauteng, the organisation blamed Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and president Cyril Ramaphosa. The organisation said the attacks on non-South Africans can be directly linked to calls by politicians to ‘defend the sovereignty of the state’ and confirms a dangerous emerging trend of \""xenophobic populism\"" which leads to attacks on foreign nationals. The statement reads: \""We recognise that there are many sources of the violence but it is also clear that statements of outrage and condemnation by state officials at all levels (Cabinet, Parliament, the Gauteng Province, SAPS and Metros) fuelled the actions of ordinary citizens who interpreted those statements to be licence to take the law into their own hands. \""Senior political leaders find an easy target in the vulnerable Africans seeking to make a new home in South Africa. \""Indeed, there is a dangerous emerging trend of xenophobic populism that leads to attacks on foreign nationals. In 2015, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’s speech, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s 2019 election campaign pronouncements, the Minister of Health’s comments on the strain placed on health services by foreign migrants, and the xenophobic blaming for Johannesburg’s ill by Mayor Herman Mashaba have been followed by xenophobic attacks in different localities. \""In all these instances, even when not responding to a direct call, political populism is used as justification by instigators and perpetrators who would have been waiting for an opportunity to strike for their own reasons. Right2Know slammed the attacks, saying they were hate crimes. They said the assaults and the looting of the foreigners’ property just because they were not born in South Africa could never be justified. The organization also said in its statement that \""These actions which are criminal in nature, when combined with the targeting of the victims as belonging to a certain group, becomes a hate crime. \""Apartheid was the experience of being stateless and homeless within one’s home country. Today, we find South Africans showing the same hatred towards fellow Africans that we ourselves suffered not too long ago. \""As hosts of the World Conference Against Racism in 2001, we recognised xenophobia (and the local Afrophobia) as expressions of racism; in 2008 we experienced how the deep roots of internalised oppression enabled us to turn our own experience of racism and oppression into actions that discriminated against, targeted and in some cases killed other Africans living in South Africa. \""It is an issue of national shame that xenophobic violence has become a regular and highly visible feature of South Africa’s political landscape. Outsiders have been regularly attacked, killed and their livelihoods destroyed since the dawn of democracy in 1994. \""Community and local leaders also incite violence against migrants by blaming local economic conditions on the presence of migrants. \""Research evidence further demonstrates that interventions to address xenophobia in the country have failed largely because of the state’s denialism (\""it is just crime and not xenophobia\""); lack of political will and impunity, all of which encourage perpetrators to strike whenever it suits their interests.\"" Chaos erupted over the weekend after residents went on a rampage following a blaze at a building that claimed three lives in Jeppestown.
